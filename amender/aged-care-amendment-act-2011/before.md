### Division 2 - Objects

##### <a id="2-1"></a>2-1  The objects of this Act

            (1)  The objects of this Act are as follows:

                     (a)  to provide for funding of * aged care that takes account of:

                             (i)  the quality of the care; and

                            (ii)  the * type of care and level of care provided; and

                           (iii)  the need to ensure access to care that is affordable by, and appropriate to the needs of, people who require it; and

                           (iv)  appropriate outcomes for recipients of the care; and

                            (v)  accountability of the providers of the care for the funding and for the outcomes for recipients;

                     (b)  to promote a high quality of care and accommodation for the recipients of * aged care services that meets the needs of individuals;

                     (c)  to protect the health and well-being of the recipients of aged care services;

                     (d)  to ensure that aged care services are targeted towards the people with the greatest needs for those services;

                     (e)  to facilitate access to aged care services by those who need them, regardless of race, culture, language, gender, economic circumstance or geographic location;

                      (f)  to provide respite for families, and others, who care for older people;

                     (g)  to encourage diverse, flexible and responsive aged care services that:

                             (i)  are appropriate to meet the needs of the recipients of those services and the carers of those recipients; and

                            (ii)  facilitate the independence of, and choice available to, those recipients and carers;

                     (h)  to help those recipients to enjoy the same rights as all other people in Australia;

                      (i)  to plan effectively for the delivery of aged care services that:

                             (i)  promote the targeting of services to areas of the greatest need and people with the greatest need; and

                            (ii)  avoid duplication of those services; and

                           (iii)  improve the integration of the planning and delivery of aged care services with the planning and delivery of related health and community services;

                      (j)  to promote ageing in place through the linking of care and support services to the places where older people prefer to live.

            (2)  In construing the objects, due regard must be had to:

                     (a)  the limited resources available to support services and programs under this Act; and

                     (b)  the need to consider equity and merit in accessing those resources.

<o:p> </o:p>

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 3 - Overview of this Act

##### <a id="3-1"></a>3-1  General

                   This Act provides for the Commonwealth to give financial support:

                     (a)  through payment of subsidies for the provision of * aged care; and

                     (b)  through payment of grants for other matters connected with the provision of aged care.

Subsidies are paid under Chapter 3 (but Chapters 2 and 4 are also relevant to subsidies), and grants are paid under Chapter 5.

##### <a id="3-2"></a>3-2  Preliminary matters relating to subsidies (Chapter 2)

                   Before the Commonwealth can pay subsidy to a provider of * aged care under Chapter 3, a number of approvals and similar decisions may need to have been made under Chapter 2\. These may relate to:

                     (a)  the provider (for example, the requirement that the provider be an approved provider); or

                     (b)  the * aged care service in question (for example, the requirement that * places have been allocated in respect of the service); or

                     (c)  the recipient of aged care (for example, the requirement that the recipient has been approved as a recipient of the type of aged care that is provided).

##### <a id="3-3"></a>3-3  Subsidies (Chapter 3)

                   A number of different kinds of subsidy can be paid under Chapter 3\. They are paid for * aged care that has been provided. Eligibility for a subsidy depends on:

                     (a)  particular approvals and similar decisions having been made under Chapter 2; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the care is provided (for example, whether the care is provided in a residential care service that meets its * accreditation requirement).

##### <a id="3-4"></a>3-4  Responsibilities of approved providers (Chapter 4)

                   Approved providers have certain responsibilities under Chapter 4\. These responsibilities relate to:

                     (a)  the quality of care they provide; and

                     (b)  user rights for the people to whom care is provided; and

                     (c)  accountability for the care that is provided, and the basic suitability of their * key personnel.

Failure to meet these responsibilities can lead to the imposition of sanctions that affect the status of approvals and similar decisions under Chapter 2 (and therefore may affect amounts of subsidy payable to an approved provider).

##### <a id="3-5"></a>3-5  Grants (Chapter 5)

                   The Commonwealth makes grants under Chapter 5 to contribute to costs associated with:

                     (a)  the establishment or enhancement of * aged care services (for example, * residential care grants); or

                     (b)  assessments or approvals related to * aged care (for example, * assessment grants); or

                     (c)  support services related to the provision of aged care (for example, * advocacy grants).

The grants are (in most cases) payable under agreements with the recipients of the grants, and may be subject to conditions.

<o:p> </o:p>

##### <a id="3-6"></a>3-6  The structure of this Act

                   This diagram sets out the basic structure of this Act.

<!--\[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1026" type="#_x0000_t75"  style='width:354pt;height:378pt'>  <v:imagedata src="before_files/image003.wmz" o:title=""/> </v:shape><!\[endif]--><!\[if !vml]>![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00837/Html/before_files/image004.gif)<!\[endif]>

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 4 - Application of this Act

##### <a id="4-1"></a>4-1  Application of this Act

            (1)  This Act applies in all the States and Territories.

            (2)  However, this Act does not apply in any external Territory, except the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

            (3)  Despite subsection (1), Parts 2.2, 2.5 and 3.1 apply in relation to the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands as if those Territories were part of Western Australia and were not Territories.

Note:          This has the effect that references in Parts 2.2, 2.5 and 3.1 to a Territory do not apply to the Territory of Christmas Island or the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and that references in those Parts to a State will be relevant to Western Australia as if it included those Territories.

##### <a id="4-2"></a>4-2  Binding the Crown

            (1)  This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities.

            (2)  This Act does not make the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an offence.

<o:p> </o:p>

# Chapter 2 - Preliminary matters relating to subsidies

### Division 5 - Introduction

##### <a id="5-1"></a>5-1  What this Chapter is about

* * *

Before the Commonwealth can pay a subsidy under Chapter 3 for the provision of care, a number of approvals and similar decisions may need to have been made. These relate to:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt"> <span style="mso-tab-count:1">    </span>the
provider of the service - the provider must be an approved provider (see
Part 2.1);</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">       the
* aged care service in question - * places must have been allocated in respect of the
service (see Part 2.2). In addition, decisions can be made under Part 2.5
allowing places in a residential care service to become * extra service places (enabling higher fees to be charged for
those places), and a residential care service can become certified under Part 2.6
(enabling * accommodation bonds and * accommodation charges to be charged);</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">       the
recipient of the care - the recipient must (in most cases) be approved in
respect of the type of * aged care provided
(see Part 2.3), and (in the case of residential care or flexible care) can
be classified in respect of the level of care that is required (see Part 2.4).</li>

* * *

Note:          Not all of these approvals and decisions are needed in respect of each kind of subsidy under Chapter 3.

##### <a id="5-2"></a>5-2  Which approvals etc. may be relevant

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 7 - What is the significance of approval as a provider of aged care?

##### <a id="7-1"></a>7-1  Pre-conditions to receiving subsidy

                   Payments of subsidy cannot be made under Chapter 3 to a person for providing * aged care unless:

                     (a)  the person is approved under this Part as a provider of aged care; and

                     (b)  the approval is in force in respect of the type of aged care provided, at the time it is provided; and

                     (c)  the approval is in force in respect of the * aged care service through which the aged care is provided, at the time it is provided.

##### <a id="14-7"></a>14-7  Allocation of places to services with extra service status

            (1)  The Secretary must not approve the allocation of * places to a residential care service that has, or a * distinct part of which has, * extra service status unless subsection (2) or (3) applies to the allocation.

            (2)  The Secretary may approve the allocation if satisfied that the * places other than the allocated places could, after the allocation, form one or more * distinct parts of the residential care service concerned.

Note:          The allocated places would not have * extra service status because of the operation of section 31-3.

            (3)  The Secretary may approve the allocation if satisfied that:

                     (a)  granting the allocation would be reasonable, having regard to the criteria set out in section 32-4; and

                     (b)  granting the allocation would not result in the maximum proportion of * extra service places under section 32-7, for the State, Territory or region concerned, being exceeded; and

            (2)  Paragraph 14-1(3)(a) and subsection 14-1(4) do not apply to an allocation that is the subject of such a declaration.

            (3)  The Secretary must not make such a declaration unless the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a situation of emergency exists that could result in, or has resulted in, * aged care ceasing to be provided to a group of care recipients; and

### Division 25 - How are care recipients classified?

##### <a id="25-1"></a>25-1  Classification of care recipients

            (1)  If the Secretary receives an appraisal under section 25-3 in respect of:

                     (a)  a care recipient who is approved under Part 2.3 for residential care; or

                     (b)  a care recipient who is approved under Part 2.3 for flexible care and whose flexible care is of a kind specified in the Classification Principles;

the Secretary must classify the care recipient according to the level of care the care recipient needs, relative to the needs of other care recipients.

            (2)  The classification must specify the appropriate * classification level for the care recipient (see section 25-2). The Classification Principles may specify methods or procedures that the Secretary must follow in determining the appropriate classification level for the care recipient.

            (3)  In classifying the care recipient, the Secretary:

                     (a)  must take into account the appraisal made in respect of the care recipient under section 25-3; and

                     (c)  must take into account any other matters specified in the Classification Principles.

            (4)  If there is no classification of the care recipient, the care recipient is taken to be classified at the * lowest applicable classification level under the Classification Principles (see subsection 25-2(3)).

            (5)  The Classification Principles may exclude a class of care recipients from classification under this Part. A care recipient who is in such a class cannot be classified under this Part for the period specified in the Classification Principles in relation to that class.

##### <a id="25-2"></a>25-2  Classification levels

            (1)  The Classification Principles may set out the * classification levels for care recipients being provided with residential care or flexible care.

            (2)  The Classification Principles may provide for any of the following:

                     (a)  for only some of the * classification levels to be available when care is provided as * respite care;

                     (b)  for different classification levels to apply when residential care is provided as respite care;

                     (c)  for different classification levels to apply in respect of flexible care.

            (3)  The Classification Principles may specify the * lowest applicable classification level. They may provide that a different level is the lowest applicable classification level when care is provided as * respite care.

            (4)  The Classification Principles may specify the criteria, in respect of each * classification level, for determining which level applies to a care recipient.

            (5)  The following are examples of matters the Classification Principles may deal with in specifying the criteria:

                     (a)  a care recipient s clinical needs;

                     (b)  the assistance a care recipient requires with the activities of daily living;

                     (c)  the assistance a care recipient requires with personal care;

                     (d)  the assistance a care recipient requires with communication or sensory processes;

                     (e)  the care recipient s need for social or emotional support.

##### <a id="25-3"></a>25-3  Appraisals of the level of care needed

            (1)  An appraisal of the level of care needed by a care recipient, relative to the needs of other care recipients, must be made by:

                     (a)  the approved provider that is providing care to the care recipient, or a person acting on the approved provider s behalf; or

                     (b)  if a person has been authorised under section 25-5 to make those appraisals - that person.

However, this subsection does not apply if the care recipient is being provided with care as * respite care.

            (2)  The appraisal:

                     (a)  must not be made during the period of 7 days starting on the day on which the approved provider began providing care to the care recipient; and

                     (b)  must not be given to the Secretary during the period of 28 days starting on the day on which the approved provider began providing care to the care recipient.

          (2A)  However, if the Classification Principles specify:

                     (a)  circumstances in which subsection (2) does not apply in relation to an appraisal; and

                     (b)  an alternative period during which the appraisal may be made in those circumstances;

the times when the appraisal may be made and given to the Secretary are to be determined in accordance with the Classification Principles.

            (3)  The appraisal must be in a form approved by the Secretary, and must be made in accordance with the procedures (if any) specified in the Classification Principles.

          (3A)  The Secretary may approve forms which must be used in the course of making an appraisal.

            (4)  If a care recipient is being, or is to be, provided with care as * respite care, an assessment of the care recipient s care needs made under section 22-4 is taken:

                     (a)  to be an appraisal of the level of care needed by the care recipient; and

                     (b)  to have been received by the Secretary under subsection 25-1(1) as such an appraisal.

##### <a id="25-4"></a>25-4  Suspending approved providers from making appraisals and reappraisals

            (1)  The Secretary may suspend an approved provider from making appraisals under section 25-3 and reappraisals under section 27-4 if:

                     (a)  the Secretary is satisfied that the approved provider, or a person acting on the approved provider s behalf, gave false, misleading or inaccurate information in a substantial number of appraisals or reappraisals connected with classifications reviewed under subsection 29-1(3); and

                     (b)  the classifications made in connection with those appraisals or reappraisals were changed under section 29-1; and

                     (c)  the Secretary is satisfied that, after those classifications were changed, the approved provider continued to give false, misleading or inaccurate information in other appraisals or reappraisals.

Note:          Suspensions of approved providers from making assessments are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (2)  In considering whether a number of appraisals or reappraisals in which false, misleading or inaccurate information was given is substantial, the Secretary must apply the criteria (if any) specified in the Classification Principles.

            (3)  Before deciding to suspend an approved provider from making appraisals and reappraisals, the Secretary must notify the approved provider that suspension is being considered. The notice must be in writing and must:

                     (a)  specify the period proposed for the suspension; and

                     (b)  invite the approved provider to make submissions, in writing, to the Secretary within 28 days after receiving the notice; and

                     (c)  inform the approved provider that if no submissions are made within that period, any suspension will take effect on the day after the last day for making submissions.

            (4)  In making the decision whether to suspend the approved provider, the Secretary must consider any submissions given to the Secretary within that period.

            (5)  The Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, of the decision:

                     (a)  not to suspend the approved provider from making appraisals and reappraisals; or

                     (b)  to suspend the approved provider from making appraisals and reappraisals for the period specified in the notice.

            (6)  The notice must be given to the approved provider within 28 days after the end of the period for making submissions. If the notice is not given within this period, the Secretary is taken to have decided not to suspend the approved provider.

          (6A)  The Secretary may specify in the notice that the suspension will not take effect if, within the period specified in the notice, the approved provider enters into an agreement with the Secretary (see section 25-4A).

          (6B)  If the Secretary does so:

                     (a)  the suspension does not take effect if the approved provider enters into the agreement within the period specified in the notice (unless the Secretary later decides under subsection 25-4B(1) that it is to take effect); and

                     (b)  the suspension takes effect on the day after the last day of the period specified in the notice, if the approved provider does not enter into the agreement within that period.

            (7)  If the Secretary does not do so, the suspension takes effect:

                     (a)  if no submission was made under subsection (3) - on the day after the last day for making submissions; or

                     (b)  if such a submission was made - 7 days after the day on which the notice under subsection (5) was given.

##### <a id="25-4A"></a>25-4A  Stay of suspension agreements

            (1)  An agreement entered into for the purposes of subsection 25-4(6A) may require the approved provider to do either or both of the following:

                     (a)  provide, at its expense, such training as is specified in the agreement for its officers, employees and agents within the period specified in the agreement;

                     (b)  appoint an adviser, approved by the Secretary, to assist the approved provider to conduct, in a proper manner, appraisals and reappraisals of the care needs of care recipients.

            (2)  If the agreement requires the approved provider to appoint an adviser, the approved provider must, within the period specified in the agreement:

                     (a)  nominate, in writing, a proposed adviser to the Secretary; and

                     (b)  give the Secretary written information about the proposed adviser, to allow the Secretary to decide whether the proposed adviser is suitable.

            (3)  The approved provider must appoint the adviser within 3 days after the approved provider is informed of the Secretary s approval.

##### <a id="25-4B"></a>25-4B  Stayed suspension may take effect

            (1)  The Secretary may decide that the suspension is to take effect, if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  if the agreement requires the approved provider to appoint an adviser - the approved provider has not complied with subsection 25-4A(2) or (3); or

                     (b)  the approved provider has not complied with the agreement; or

                     (c)  despite having complied with the agreement, the approved provider has continued not to conduct in a proper manner appraisals and reappraisals of the care needs of care recipients provided with care through the aged care service.

            (2)  If the Secretary decides that the suspension is to take effect, the Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, of the decision.

            (3)  The suspension takes effect 7 days after the day on which that notice is given and has effect from that day for the whole of the suspension period specified in the notice under subsection 25-4(5).

            (4)  The Secretary must not give an approved provider a notice under subsection (2) after the last day on which the suspension would have had effect had the approved provider not entered into the agreement.

##### <a id="25-4C"></a>25-4C  Applications for lifting of suspension

### Division 26 - When do classifications take effect?

##### <a id="26-1"></a>26-1  Appraisals received within the appropriate period - care other than respite care

                   A classification of a care recipient (other than a classification in relation to care provided as * respite care) is taken to have had effect from the day on which the approved provider began providing care to the care recipient, if the appraisal by that approved provider is received by the Secretary:

                     (a)  within the period specified in the Classification Principles; or

                     (b)  if no such period is so specified - within 2 months after the day on which provision of the care to the care recipient began.

##### <a id="26-2"></a>26-2  Appraisals not received within the appropriate period - care other than respite care

            (1)  A classification of a care recipient (other than a classification in relation to care provided as * respite care) takes effect from the day an appraisal of the care recipient is received by the Secretary if the appraisal is received outside the period in paragraph 26-1(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable).

            (2)  However, if the Secretary is satisfied that the appraisal was sent in sufficient time to be received by the Secretary, in the ordinary course of events, within that period, the classification is taken to have had effect from the day the care recipient began being provided with the level of care specified in the appraisal.

Note:          A decision that the Secretary is not satisfied an appraisal was sent in sufficient time is reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (3)  In considering whether an appraisal received outside that period was sent in sufficient time, the Secretary may have regard to any information, relevant to that question, that the approved provider gives to the Secretary.

            (4)  The Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, if the Secretary is not satisfied that the appraisal received outside that period was sent in sufficient time.

##### <a id="26-3"></a>26-3  When respite care classifications take effect

                   A classification of a care recipient in relation to care provided as * respite care takes effect on a day specified in the Classification Principles.

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 27 - Expiry and renewal of classifications

##### <a id="27-1"></a>27-1  When do classifications cease to have effect?

            (1)  A classification that has an * expiry date under section 27-2 ceases to have effect on that date, unless it is renewed under section 27-6.

            (2)  A classification that does not have an * expiry date under section 27-2 continues to have effect but may be renewed under section 27-6 if a reappraisal is made under section 27-4.

##### <a id="27-2"></a>27-2  Expiry dates and reappraisal periods

            (1)  The following table sets out:

                     (a)  when a classification has an * expiry date; and

                     (b)  when that expiry date occurs; and

Note:          If a classification has an expiry date but no reappraisal period, the classification cannot be renewed (see subsection 27-6(1)).

Reappraisal period deferred if care recipient on leave

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  the * expiry date for the classification occurs:

                             (i)  while the care recipient is on * leave (other than * extended hospital leave) from a residential care service; or

                            (ii)  within one month after the residential care service began providing residential care to the care recipient after that leave ended; and

                     (b)  the classification does not have that expiry date because of item 6 of the table in subsection (1);

then, despite subsection (1), the reappraisal period for the classification is the period of 2 months beginning on the day on which the residential care service began providing residential care to the care recipient after that leave ended.

If more than one expiry date applies

            (3)  If:

                     (a)  a classification has an * expiry date (the **_first expiry date_**) because a particular circumstance specified in the table in subsection (1) applies in relation to the care recipient; and

                     (b)  another circumstance specified in that table starts to apply in relation to the care recipient before the first expiry date;

then, subject to subsection (4):

                     (c)  the first expiry date ceases to apply in relation to the classification; and

                     (d)  the expiry date for the other circumstance applies in relation to the classification.

            (4)  If the other circumstance is that specified in item 6 of the table:

                     (a)  the first expiry date continues to apply in relation to the classification, unless the relevant notice under section 27-3 is given before the start of the reappraisal period for the first expiry date; and

                     (b)  the * expiry date for the circumstance specified in item 6 of the table does not apply.

If reappraisal made at initiative of approved provider before expiry date

            (5)  If:

                     (a)  a classification has an * expiry date because a particular circumstance specified in the table in subsection (1) applies in relation to the care recipient; and

                     (b)  before the start of the reappraisal period for that expiry date, the Secretary receives a reappraisal of the level of care needed by the care recipient made under section 27-4;

that expiry date ceases to apply in relation to the classification.

Classification Principles may specify different expiry date or reappraisal period

            (6)  The Classification Principles may specify that:

                     (a)  a different * expiry date applies in relation to a classification to that provided for under this section; or

                     (b)  a different reappraisal period applies in respect of an expiry date to that provided for under this section.

Meaning of **in-patient hospital episode**

            (7)  In this section, **_in-patient hospital episode_**, in relation to a care recipient, means a continuous period during which the care recipient:

                     (a)  is an in-patient of a hospital; and

                     (b)  is provided with medical or related care or services.

##### <a id="27-3"></a>27-3  Reappraisal required by Secretary

            (1)  If:

## Part 2.5 - Extra service places

### Division 30 - Introduction

##### <a id="30-1"></a>30-1  What this Part is about

* * *

A * place in respect of which residential care is provided may become an extra service place. Extra service places involve providing a significantly higher standard of accommodation, food and services to care recipients. Extra service places can attract higher resident fees, but a lower amount of * residential care subsidy is payable.

* * *

Note 1:       For resident fees, see Division 58.

Note 2:       For the lower amount of * residential care subsidy, see section 44-18, and also sections 44-6, 44-29 and 44-30\. Further amounts may be deducted to recover capital payments (see section 43-6).

Note 3:       * Extra service status also affects an approved provider s future entitlement for capital payments (see subsection 72-1(4)).

Note 4:       The rules for various matters relating to allocations of places are also affected by * extra service status (see sections 14-7, 16-8 and 17-8).

**Table of Divisions**

30         Introduction

31         When is a place an extra service place?

32         How is extra service status granted?

33         When does extra service status cease?

35         How are extra service fees approved?

36         When is residential care provided on an extra service basis?

##### <a id="30-2"></a>30-2  The Extra Service Principles

                   Extra service places are also dealt with in the Extra Service Principles. The provisions of this Part indicate where a particular matter is or may be dealt with in these Principles.

Note:          The Extra Service Principles are made by the Minister under section 96-1.

##### <a id="30-3"></a>30-3  Meaning of _distinct part_

            (1)  For the purposes of this Part, **_distinct part_**, in relation to a residential care service, means a specific area of the service that:

                     (a)  is physically identifiable as separate from all the other * places included in the service; and

                     (b)  includes sufficient living space for the care recipients to whom residential care is provided in respect of the places in the area; and

                     (c)  meets any other requirements specified in the Extra Service Principles.

Example:    A wing of a service with a separate living and dining area for residents living in the wing might constitute a  distinct part  of the service.

Note:          If the Secretary approves an application for * extra service status for a distinct part of a service, all the places in that distinct part will be extra service places at a particular time as long as the requirements of section 31-1 are met.

            (2)  The Extra Service Principles may specify characteristics that must be present in order for an area to be physically identifiable as separate for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a).

                     (b)  the allocation or transfer was in accordance with subsection 14-7(2), 16-8(2) or 16-20(2);

the allocated or transferred places are taken, for the purposes of this Part, not to have extra service status.

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Secretary approves a variation, under Division 17, of the conditions to which an allocation of * places is subject; and

                     (b)  as a result of the variation, care in respect of the places is provided through a residential care service in a different location; and

            (1)  An approved provider is eligible for * residential care subsidy in respect of a day if the Secretary is satisfied that, during that day:

                     (a)  the approved provider holds an allocation of * places for residential care subsidy that is in force under Part 2.2 (not being a * provisional allocation); and

                     (b)  the approved provider provides residential care to a care recipient in respect of whom an approval is in force under Part 2.3 as a recipient of residential care; and

                     (c)  the residential care service through which the care is provided meets its * accreditation requirement (if any) applying at that time (see section 42-4).

Note 1:       A care recipient can be taken to be provided with residential care while he or she is on * leave from that care (see section 42-2).

Note 2:       If the care recipient s approval under Part 2.3 is not in force, subsidy will not be payable. (For example, the approval may have been given only for a limited period.)

            (2)  However, the approved provider is not eligible in respect of residential care provided to the care recipient during that day if:

                     (a)  it is excluded because the approved provider exceeds the approved provider s allocation of * places for residential care subsidy (see section 42-7); or

                     (b)  the approved provider stopped providing residential care to the person during that day; or

                     (c)  subject to subsections (3) and (4), another approved provider would, but for this paragraph, also be eligible for * residential care subsidy in respect of residential care provided to the same care recipient during that day.

            (3)  Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply if the approved provider started providing residential care to the care recipient before the other approved provider.

            (4)  Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the care recipient is on * leave under section 42-2 from the residential care service through which the approved provider provides residential care to the care recipient at a level that is not a * high level of residential care; and

                     (b)  the care recipient s approval under Part 2.3 is not limited under subsection 22-2(3) to a * low level of residential care; and

                     (c)  the other approved provider is providing to the care recipient, on a temporary basis, a high level of residential care; and

                     (d)  the approved provider referred to in paragraph (a) is unable to provide that high level of residential care.

Note:          Eligibility may also be affected by Division 7 (relating to a person s approval as a provider of aged care services) or Division 20 (relating to a person s approval as a recipient of residential care).

##### <a id="42-2"></a>42-2  Leave from residential care services

            (1)  On each day during which a care recipient is on * leave under this section from a residential care service, the care recipient is taken, for the purposes of this Part (other than section 42-3) and for the purposes of section 67A-5, to be provided with residential care by the approved provider operating the residential care service.

            (2)  A care recipient is on * leave under this section from a residential care service on each day of any period during which the care recipient attends a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment, so long as the day is on or after the day on which the care recipient * enters the residential care service.

Note:          Attending a hospital for a period of extended hospital leave may result in the Minister determining a lower basic subsidy amount for the recipient for days occurring during that period, which will affect the amount of subsidy that is payable (see section 44-3).

            (3)  A care recipient is on * leave under this section from a residential care service on a day if:

                     (a)  during the whole of that day, the care recipient is absent from the residential care service; and

                     (b)  either:

                             (i)  the care recipient does not, during that day, attend a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment; or

                            (ii)  the care recipient does, during that day, attend a hospital for that purpose and the day is before the day on which the care recipient * enters the residential care service; and

                     (c)  the number of days on which the care recipient has previously been on leave under this subsection, during the current financial year, is less than 52.

Note:          If a care recipient is taken not to have been provided with care because the maximum number of days has been exceeded, subsidy will not be payable in respect of those days. However, the care recipient may agree to pay a fee to the approved provider to reserve the care recipient s * place in the service. The maximum amount in such a case is set by section 58-6.

          (3A)  A care recipient is on * leave under this section from a residential care service on a day if:

                     (a)  * flexible care subsidy is payable in respect of the care recipient and the day; and

                     (b)  the requirements specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles for the purposes of this paragraph are met.

Note:          If a care recipient is on leave for at least 30 days continuously under subsections (2) and (3A), this may result in the Minister determining a lower basic subsidy amount for the recipient for days occurring during that period, which will affect the amount of residential care subsidy that is payable (see section 44-3).

            (4)  Despite subsections (2), (3) and (3A), a care recipient cannot be on * leave under this section from a residential care service during any period during which the residential care in question would have been * respite care.

##### <a id="42-3"></a>42-3  Working out periods of leave

            (1)  In working out the days on which a care recipient is on * leave under section 42-2:

                     (a)  include the day on which the period commenced; and

                     (b)  do not include the day on which the approved provider recommenced, or commenced, providing residential care to the care recipient.

Note:          Absences that do not include an overnight absence from a residential care service are not counted as * leave because of paragraph (b).

            (2)  Subject to subsection (3), a care recipient cannot be on * leave under section 42-2 from a residential care service before he or she * enters the service.

            (3)  A care recipient may be on leave under section 42-2 on the days during the period starting on the later of:

                     (a)  the day on which he or she was notified that there was a vacancy in the residential care service in question; or

                    (aa)  the day on which he or she accepted a place in the residential care service; or

                     (b)  the day that is 7 days, or such other period as is specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles, before the day on which the person * enters the residential care service;

and ending on the day of entry.

##### <a id="42-4"></a>42-4  Accreditation requirement

                   A residential care service meets its accreditation requirement at all times during which:

                     (a)  there is in force an accreditation of the service by an * accreditation body; or

                     (b)  there is in force a determination under section 42-5 that the service is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to meet its accreditation requirement.

##### <a id="42-5"></a>42-5  Determinations allowing for exceptional circumstances

            (1)  The Secretary may determine, in accordance with the Residential Care Subsidy Principles, that a residential care service is taken, for the purposes of this Division, to meet its * accreditation requirement. However, the Secretary must first be satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply to the service.

Note:          Refusals to make determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (2)  The following are examples of the matters that the Residential Care Subsidy Principles may require the Secretary to take into account:

                     (a)  the reasons for a residential care service not meeting the standards required for accreditation;

                     (b)  the action that the approved provider conducting a residential care service must take for the service to meet those standards;

                     (c)  the impact of a residential care service not meeting those standards on the residential care, accommodation and other services provided through the service to care recipients.

            (3)  The Secretary must not make a determination if:

                     (a)  there is an immediate or severe risk to the safety or well-being of care recipients to whom residential care is being provided through the residential care service; or

                     (b)  the approved provider has not applied for accreditation of the service; or

                     (c)  a determination under this section has previously been made in relation to the service  and the service has not subsequently met its * accreditation requirement as set out in section 42-4; or

                     (d)  any circumstances specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles for the purposes of this paragraph apply.

            (4)  A determination ceases to be in force on the earlier of:

                     (a)  the end of 6 months, or such shorter period as is specified in the determination, after the determination is made; or

                     (b)  the occurrence of a specified event, if the determination so provides.

Note:          Determinations specifying periods or events are reviewable under Part 6.1.

          (4A)  A determination made under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

            (5)  If the Secretary needs further information to determine the application, the Secretary may give to the applicant a notice requesting the applicant to give the further information within 28 days after receiving the notice.

            (6)  The application is taken to be withdrawn if the applicant does not give the further information within 28 days.

Note:          The period for giving the further information can be extended - see section 96-7.

            (7)  The notice must contain a statement setting out the effect of subsection (6).

            (8)  The Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, of the Secretary s decision on whether to make the determination. If the Secretary makes the determination, the notice must inform the approved provider of:

                     (a)  the period at the end of which; and

                     (b)  any event on the occurrence of which;

the determination will cease to be in force.

            (9)  A notice under subsection (8) must be given to the approved provider:

                     (a)  within 28 days after receiving the application; or

                     (b)  if the Secretary has requested further information under subsection (5) - within 28 days after receiving the information.

##### <a id="42-6"></a>42-6  Revocation of determinations

            (1)  The Secretary must revoke a determination under section 42-5 if satisfied that:

                     (a)  the exceptional circumstances that applied to the residential care service in question at the time the determination was made no longer apply; or

                     (b)  circumstances have changed such that one or more of the circumstances referred to in subsection 42-5(3) now applies.

Note:          Revocations of determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (2)  The Secretary must, in writing, notify the approved provider conducting the service of the Secretary s decision to revoke the determination. The notice must be given within 7 days after the decision is made.

##### <a id="42-7"></a>42-7  Exceeding the number of places for which there is an allocation

            (1)  For the purposes of a person s eligibility for * residential care subsidy, residential care provided to a particular care recipient on a particular day is excluded if:

                     (a)  the number of care recipients provided with residential care by the approved provider during that day exceeds the number of * places included in the approved provider s allocation of places for residential care subsidy; and

                     (b)  the Secretary decides, in accordance with subsection (2), that the residential care provided to that particular care recipient on that day is to be excluded.

            (2)  In deciding under paragraph (1)(b) which residential care is to be excluded, the Secretary must:

                     (a)  make the number of exclusions necessary to ensure that the number of * places for which * residential care subsidy will be payable does not exceed the number of places included in the approved provider s allocation of places for residential care subsidy; and

                     (b)  exclude the residential care in the reverse order in which the care recipients * entered the residential care service for the provision of residential care.

##### <a id="42-8"></a>42-8  Notice of refusal to pay residential care subsidy

            (1)  If:

                     (a)  an approved provider has claimed * residential care subsidy in respect of a person; and

                     (b)  the approved provider is not eligible for residential care subsidy in respect of that person;

the Secretary must notify the approved provider, in writing, accordingly.

            (2)  A notice given under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

### Division 43 - How is residential care subsidy paid?

##### <a id="43-1"></a>43-1  Payment of residential care subsidy

            (1)  Residential care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth to an approved provider in respect of each * payment period (see section 43-2) during which the approved provider is eligible under section 42-1\. However, it is not payable in respect of any days during that period on which the approved provider is not eligible.

            (2)  Residential care subsidy is separately payable by the Commonwealth in respect of each residential care service through which the approved provider provides residential care.

            (3)  The Secretary may, in accordance with the Residential Care Subsidy Principles, deduct from the amount of residential care subsidy otherwise payable in respect of a * payment period such of the following amounts as apply to the residential care service in question:

                     (a)  deductions for fees (see section 43-5);

                     (b)  * capital repayment deductions (see section 43-6);

                     (d)  non-compliance deductions (see section 43-8).

##### <a id="43-2"></a>43-2  Meaning of _payment period_

                   A **_payment period_** is:

                     (a)  a calendar month; or

                     (b)  such other period as is set out in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

##### <a id="43-3"></a>43-3  Advances

            (1)  Subject to subsection 43-4(2), * residential care subsidy is payable by the Commonwealth in advance, in respect of a * payment period, at such times as the Secretary thinks fit.

            (2)  The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of the first * payment period or the second payment period for a residential care service by estimating the amount of * residential care subsidy that will be payable for the days in that period.

            (3)  The Secretary must work out the amount of an advance to be paid to an approved provider in respect of subsequent * payment periods for a residential care service by:

                     (a)  estimating the amount of * residential care subsidy that will be payable (taking into account any deductions under subsection 43-1(3)) for the days in the period; and

                     (b)  increasing or reducing that amount to make any adjustments that the Secretary reasonably believes are necessary to take account of likely underpayments or overpayments in respect of advances previously paid under this section.

            (4)  The amounts of advances must be worked out in accordance with any requirements set out in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

            (5)  The Secretary may, in deciding whether to reduce the amount of an advance under paragraph (3)(b), take into account the likelihood of the Commonwealth s right to recover a particular overpayment being waived under section 95-6.

Note:          Subsection (5) allows the Secretary to take account of waivers in respect of overpayments caused, for example, by some cases of incorrect determinations of the * ordinary incomes of care recipients.

##### <a id="43-4"></a>43-4  Claims for residential care subsidy

            (1)  For the purpose of obtaining payment of * residential care subsidy in respect of a residential care service through which an approved provider provides residential care, the approved provider must, as soon as practicable after the end of each * payment period, give to the Secretary:

                     (a)  a claim, in the form approved by the Secretary, for residential care subsidy that is payable in respect of the residential care service for that payment period; and

                     (b)  any information relating to the claim that is stated in the form to be required, or that the Secretary requests; and

                     (c)  copies of any documents relating to the claim, or to the payment of * residential care subsidy, that are stated in the form to be required, or that the Secretary requests.

            (2)  An advance of * residential care subsidy is not payable in respect of a * payment period for the residential care service if the approved provider has not given to the Secretary under subsection (1) a claim relating to the second last preceding payment period for the service.

Example:    An advance of subsidy is not payable for March if the Secretary has not been given a claim for January of the same year (assuming the * payment periods are all calendar months - see section 43-2).

            (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the first * payment period or the second payment period for a residential care service.

            (4)  If all the places in a residential care service are transferred from one person to another, subsection (2) does not apply to the first 2 * payment periods for the residential care service that occur after the transfer took effect.

            (5)  If:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, the operation of paragraph (1)(c) would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and

                     (b)  the acquisition would be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution;

the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation of a reasonable amount to the person in respect of the acquisition.

##### <a id="43-4A"></a>43-4A  Variations of claims for residential care subsidy

            (1)  An approved provider may vary the claim made in respect of a * payment period within:

                     (a)  2 years after the end of the payment period; or

                     (b)  such longer period as is determined in respect of the claim by the Secretary.

            (2)  In determining a longer period for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the Secretary must be satisfied that a variation is required:

                     (a)  due to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  because the Commonwealth or an agent of the Commonwealth considers that the circumstances of a care recipient are different from those on the basis of which subsidy was claimed.

Note:          Determinations of periods under paragraph (1)(b) are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (3)  A determination made under paragraph (1)(b) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="43-5"></a>43-5  Deductions for fees

                   The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with an approved provider, under which:

                     (a)  amounts equal to the fees payable by the approved provider for applications made under this Act are to be deducted from amounts of * residential care subsidy otherwise payable to the approved provider in respect of the residential care service specified in the agreement; and

                     (b)  so far as amounts are so deducted, the approved provider ceases to be liable to the Commonwealth for payment of the fees.

##### <a id="43-6"></a>43-6  Capital repayment deductions

            (1)  Capital repayment deductions apply in respect of a residential care service if:

                     (a)  the approved provider is granted * extra service status under Division 32 in respect of the service, or in respect of a * distinct part of the service; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth has previously made capital payments in respect of the service, whether or not the payments were made to that approved provider; and

(c)  the payments have not been repaid to the Commonwealth.

The capital repayment deductions are applied in accordance with an agreement entered into under this section.

            (2)  The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with the approved provider, under which:

                     (a)  amounts equal to the capital payments made in respect of the service are to be deducted from amounts of * residential care subsidy otherwise payable to the approved provider in respect of the service; and

                     (b)  so far as amounts are so deducted, the approved provider ceases to be liable to the Commonwealth for repayment in respect of the capital payments.

Note:          Entering into such an agreement may be a condition of the granting of * extra service status (see paragraph 32-8(5)(b)).

            (3)  However, only a proportion of the amounts equal to the capital payments made in respect of the service are to be deducted under the agreement if:

                     (a)  * extra service status is granted only in respect of a * distinct part of the service; or

                     (b)  some or all of the capital payments were made more than 5 years before the first of the deductions is to be made; or

                     (c)  the circumstances (if any) specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles apply.

The proportion is to be worked out in accordance with the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

            (4)  The agreement must provide for the deductions to be completed within 3 years after the making of the first deduction.

            (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="capit-payment"></a>**_capital payment_** means:

                     (a)  a * residential care grant; or

                     (g)  a payment of a kind specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

##### <a id="43-8"></a>43-8  Non-compliance deductions

            (1)  Subject to subsection (2), non-compliance deductions apply in respect of a residential care service if conditions, to which the allocation of the * places included in the service are subject under section 14-5 or 14-6, relating to:

                     (a)  the proportion of care to be provided to * supported residents, * concessional residents and * assisted residents; or

                     (b)  the proportion of care to be provided to recipients of * respite care;

have not been met.

            (2)  The Residential Care Subsidy Principles may specify circumstances in which non-compliance deductions do not apply even if the conditions referred to in subsection (1) have not been met.

            (3)  The Secretary must notify the approved provider conducting a residential care service if, in respect of a * payment period, non-compliance deductions apply in respect of the residential care service. The notice must be in writing and must set out why non-compliance deductions apply.

          (3A)  A notice given under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.

            (4)  The amount of a non-compliance deduction is the amount worked out in accordance with the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

Note:          Non-compliance deductions do not affect the maximum fees payable by residents (see Division 58).

##### <a id="43-9"></a>43-9  Recovery of overpayments

                   This Division does not affect the Commonwealth s right to recover overpayments under Part 6.5.

### Division 44 - What is the amount of residential care subsidy?

##### <a id="44-1"></a>44-1  What this Division is about

* * *

Amounts of * residential care subsidy payable under Division 43 to an approved provider are worked out under this Division in respect of each residential care service. The amount in respect of a residential care service is determined by adding together amounts worked out, using the residential care subsidy calculator in section 44-2, in respect of individual care recipients in the service.

* * *

#### Subdivision 44-A - Working out the amount of residential care subsidy

##### <a id="44-2"></a>44-2  Amount of residential care subsidy

            (1)  The amount of * residential care subsidy payable to an approved provider for a residential care service in respect of a * payment period is the amount worked out by adding together the amounts of residential care subsidy for each care recipient:

                     (a)  to whom the approved provider provided residential care through the residential care service during the period; and

                     (b)  in respect of whom the approved provider was eligible for residential care subsidy during the period.

            (2)  This is how to work out the amount of * residential care subsidy for a care recipient in respect of the * payment period.

* * *

**Residential care subsidy calculator**

Step 1.   Work out the **_basic subsidy amount_** using Subdivision 44-B.

Step 2\. Add to this amount the amounts of any **_primary supplements_** worked out using Subdivision 44-C.

Step 3\. Subtract the amounts of any **_reductions in subsidy_** worked out using Subdivision 44-D.

Step 4\. Subtract any further reduction worked out by applying the **_income test_** under Subdivision 44-E.

Step 5\. Add the amounts of any **_other supplements_** worked out using Subdivision 44-F.

The result is the **_amount of residential care subsidy_** for the care recipient in respect of the payment period.

* * *

#### Subdivision 44-B - The basic subsidy amount

##### <a id="44-3"></a>44-3  The basic subsidy amount

            (1)  The basic subsidy amount for the care recipient in respect of the * payment period is the sum of all the basic subsidy amounts for the days during the period on which the care recipient was provided with residential care through the residential care service in question.

            (2)  The basic subsidy amount for a day is the amount determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

            (3)  The Minister may determine different amounts (including nil amounts) based on any one or more of the following:

                     (a)  the * classification levels for care recipients being provided with residential care;

                    (aa)  whether the care recipient s approval under Part 2.3 is limited under subsection 22-2(3) to a * low level of residential care;

                     (b)  whether the residential care being provided is * respite care;

                     (c)  the times at which a care recipient * entered a residential care service;

                    (ca)  whether a care recipient is on * extended hospital leave;

                    (cb)  whether an appraisal of a care recipient s care needs is received after the end of the period mentioned in paragraph 26-1(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable);

                    (cc)  whether a reappraisal of a care recipient s care needs is received after the end of the reappraisal period for the classification determined under section 27-2;

                     (d)  the State or Territory in which a residential care service is located;

                     (e)  any other matters specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles;

                      (f)  any other matters determined by the Minister.

            (4)  The Minister must not determine a different amount for a day based on the care recipient being on * extended hospital leave that is less than half of the amount that would have been the basic subsidy amount if the care recipient had not been on extended hospital leave on that day.

#### Subdivision 44-C - Primary supplements

##### <a id="44-5"></a>44-5  Primary supplements

                   The primary supplements for the care recipient under step 2 of the residential care subsidy calculator in section 44-2 are such of the following supplements as apply to the care recipient in respect of the * payment period:

                  (aaa)  the accommodation supplement (see section 44-5A);

                     (a)  the concessional resident supplement (see section 44-6);

                    (aa)  the charge exempt resident supplement (see section 44-8A);

##### <a id="44-10"></a>44-10  How to work out the value of a person s assets

            (1)  Subject to this section, the value of a person s assets for the purposes of section 44-5A, 44-5B, 44-7, 44-8 or 44-8AB is to be worked out in accordance with the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

          (1A)  If a person who is receiving an * income support supplement or a * service pension has an income stream (within the meaning of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_) that was purchased on or after 20 September 2007, the value of the person s assets:

                     (a)  is taken to include the amount that the Secretary determines to be the value of that income stream that would be included in the value of the person s assets if Subdivision A of Division 11 of Part IIIB of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_ applied for the purposes of this Act; and

                     (b)  is taken to exclude the amount that the Secretary determines to be the value of that income stream that would not be included in the value of the person s assets if Subdivision A of Division 11 of Part IIIB of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_ applied for the purposes of this Act.

          (1B)  If a person who is not receiving an * income support supplement or a * service pension has an income stream (within the meaning of the _Social Security Act 1991_) that was purchased on or after 20 September 2007, the value of the person s assets:

                     (a)  is taken to include the amount that the Secretary determines to be the value of that income stream that would be included in the value of the person s assets if Division 1 of Part 3.12 of the _Social Security Act 1991_ applied for the purposes of this Act; and

                     (b)  is taken to exclude the amount that the Secretary determines to be the value of that income stream that would not be included in the value of the person s assets if Division 1 of Part 3.12 of the _Social Security Act 1991_ applied for the purposes of this Act.

          (1C)  The value of a person s assets is taken to include the amount that the Secretary determines to be the amount:

                     (a)  if the person is receiving an * income support supplement or a * service pension - that would be included in the value of the person s assets if Subdivisions B and BB of Division 11 and Subdivision H of Division 11A of Part IIIB of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_ applied for the purposes of this Act; and

                     (b)  otherwise - that would be included in the value of the person s assets if Division 2 of Part 3.12 and Division 8 of Part 3.18 of the _Social Security Act 1991_ applied for the purposes of this Act.

Note 1:       Subdivisions B and BB of Division 11 of Part IIIB of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_, and Division 2 of Part 3.12 of the _Social Security Act 1991_, deal with disposal of assets.

Note 2:       Subdivision H of Division 11A of Part IIIB of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_, and Division 8 of Part 3.18 of the _Social Security Act 1991_, deal with the attribution to individuals of assets of private companies and private trusts.

            (2)  In working out the value at a particular time of the assets of a person who is or was a * homeowner then, disregard the value of a home that, at the time, was occupied by:

                     (a)  the * partner or a * dependent child of the person; or

                     (b)  a carer of the person who:

                             (i)  had occupied the home for the past 2 years; and

                             (i)  had occupied the home for the past 5 years; and

                            (ii)  was eligible to receive an * income support payment at the time.

            (3)  The value of the assets of a person who is a * member of a couple is taken to be 50% of the sum of:

                     (a)  the value of the person s assets; and

                     (b)  the value of the assets of the person s * partner.

            (4)  A reference to the value of the assets of a person is, in relation to an asset owned by the person jointly or in common with one or more other people, a reference to the value of the person s interest in the asset.

            (5)  A determination under paragraph (1A)(a), (1A)(b), (1B)(a) or (1B)(b) or subsection (1C) is not a legislative instrument.

Note:          Determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (7)  A determination under subsection (5) or (6) must be in writing and notice of it must be given to the care recipient.

#### Subdivision 44-E - The income test

##### <a id="44-21"></a>44-21  The income test

            (1)  The income test for the care recipient under step 4 of the residential care subsidy calculator in section 44-2 is applied by working out the amount (if any) of the income tested reduction in respect of the * payment period.

            (2)  The income tested reduction in respect of the * payment period is the sum of all the * daily income tested reductions for days during the period on which the care recipient is provided with residential care through the residential care service in question.

            (3)  The * daily income tested reduction for a particular day is worked out as follows:

* * *

**Income tested reduction calculator**

Step 1.   Work out the care recipient s * total assessable income on a yearly basis (see section 44-24).

Step 2.   Work out the care recipient s * total assessable income free area (see section 44-26).

Step 3.   If the care recipient s * total assessable income does not exceed the care recipient s * total assessable income free area, the income tested reduction is zero.

Step 4.   If the care recipient s * total assessable income exceeds the care recipient s * total assessable income free area, the smallest of the following amounts (rounded down to the nearest cent) is the * **_daily income tested reduction_**:

              (a)     the amount equal to 5/12 of that excess (worked out on a per day basis);

Note:          Refusals to make determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (3)  The determination ceases to be in force at the end of the period (if any) specified in the determination.

Note:          Decisions specifying periods are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (4)  In deciding whether to make a determination, the Secretary must have regard to the matters specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

            (5)  Application may be made to the Secretary, in the form approved by the Secretary, for a determination under subsection (2) in respect of a care recipient. The application may be made by:

                     (b)  if such an application was not made - within 28 days after the decision is made.

            (7)  A determination under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="44-23"></a>44-23  Effect on daily income tested reduction of failure to give requested information

            (1)  If the care recipient fails to give to the Secretary information, within the time specified in a notice under subsection 44-24(8), that the Secretary requests for the purpose of determining the care recipient s * total assessable income under section 44-24, the * daily income tested reduction in respect of the care recipient, for each day during the period:

                     (a)  starting on the day on which the care recipient failed to give the information; and

                     (b)  finishing at the end of the day before the day on which the care recipient gives to the Secretary the information requested;

is the amount worked out under subsection (4) of this section.

            (2)  If the care recipient elects, by a written notice given to the Secretary, not to give any information to the Secretary for the purpose of determining the care recipient s * total assessable income under section 44-24, the * daily income tested reduction in respect of the care recipient, for each day during the period:

                     (a)  starting on the day on which the care recipient made the election; and

                     (b)  finishing at the end of, the day before the day on which the care recipient gives to the Secretary a written notice revoking the election;

                     (b)  the amount worked out in respect of the * payment period using steps 1, 2 and 3 of the residential care subsidy calculator in section 44-2 (worked out on a per day basis).

Note:          Care recipients are not obliged to give information to the Secretary. However, if they do not, the amount of residential care subsidy paid for their care may be reduced, and the amount of resident fees that they are liable to pay may therefore increase (see Division 58).

##### <a id="44-24"></a>44-24  The care recipient s _total assessable income_

            (1)  If the care recipient is not entitled to an * income support payment, his or her **_total assessable income_** is the amount the Secretary determines to be the amount that would be worked out as the care recipient s ordinary income for the purpose of applying Module E of Pension Rate Calculator A at the end of section 1064 of the _Social Security Act 1991_.

Note:          Determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (2)  If the care recipient is entitled to a * service pension, his or her **_total assessable income_** is the sum of:

                     (a)  the amount of the care recipient s service pension reduced by the amount worked out under subsection 5GA(3) of the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_ to be the care recipient s minimum pension supplement amount; and

                     (b)  the amount the Secretary determines to be the amount that would be worked out as the care recipient s ordinary/adjusted income for the purpose of applying Module E of the Rate Calculator in Schedule 6 to the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_.

Note:          Determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (4)  If the care recipient is entitled to an * income support payment (other than an * income support supplement or a * service pension), his or her **_total assessable income_** is the sum of:

                     (a)  the amount of the care recipient s income support payment reduced by, if the payment is an income support payment within the meaning of subsection 23(1) of the _Social Security Act 1991_, the amount worked out under subsection 20A(4) of that Act  to be the care recipient s minimum pension supplement amount; and

                     (b)  the amount the Secretary determines to be the amount that would be worked out as the care recipient s ordinary income for the purpose of applying Module E of Pension Rate Calculator A at the end of section 1064 of the _Social Security Act 1991_.

                            (ii)  that is specified in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.

Note:          The effect of this subsection is that certain amounts that would not be included when working out a person s ordinary/adjusted income under the _Veterans  Entitlements Act 1986_ will be included for the purposes of working out a care recipient s total assessable income under this section.

Note:          The supplements under this Subdivision are not taken into account in applying the income test under Subdivision 44-E. (The supplements under Subdivision 44-C are taken into account in applying the income test.)

##### <a id="44-28"></a>44-28  The pensioner supplement

            (1)  The pensioner supplement for the care recipient in respect of the * payment period is the sum of all the pensioner supplements for the days during the period on which:

                     (b)  either:

                             (i)  if the time (the **_entry time_**) of the care recipient s entry was before 20 September 2009 - that accommodation bond exceeded the amount obtained by rounding to the nearest $500.00 (rounding $250.00 upwards) an amount equal to 10 times the * basic age pension amount; or

                            (ii)  if the time (the **_entry time_**) of the care recipient s entry was on or after 20 September 2009 - that accommodation bond exceeded the amount obtained by rounding to the nearest $500.00 (rounding $250.00 upwards) an amount equal to 9 times the * basic age pension amount;

unless, on that day, the care recipient had a dependent child.

            (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), if the care recipient elects under subsection 57-17(1) to pay an * accommodation bond by periodic payments, the amount of the accommodation bond is taken to be what would have been payable by the care recipient in accordance with Subdivision 57-D had the care recipient paid it as a lump sum.

            (5)  If the care recipient has failed to give to the Secretary information that the Secretary requests for the purpose of determining the care recipient s * total assessable income under section 44-24, the care recipient is not eligible for a pensioner supplement for any of the days during the period:

                     (b)  finishing at the end of the day before the day on which the care recipient gives to the Secretary a written notice revoking the election.

Note:          Care recipients are not obliged to give the Secretary the information. They can choose not to give the information, but, in addition to the effect this has on the income test (see section 44-23), a pensioner supplement will not apply.

            (7)  The pensioner supplement for a particular day is the amount determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

            (8)  The Minister may determine different amounts (including nil amounts) based on any matters determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 46 - Who is eligible for community care subsidy?

##### <a id="46-1"></a>46-1  Eligibility for community care subsidy

            (1)  An approved provider is eligible for * community care subsidy in respect of a day if the Secretary is satisfied that, during that day:

                     (a)  the approved provider holds an allocation of * places for community care subsidy that is in force under Part 2.2 (other than a * provisional allocation); and

                     (b)  there is in force a * community care agreement under which a care recipient approved under Part 2.3 in respect of community care is to be provided with community care by the approved provider, whether or not the care is to be provided on that day; and

                     (c)  the approved provider provides the care recipient with such community care (if any) as is required under the community care agreement.

Note:          A care recipient can be taken to be provided with community care while the provision of that care is temporarily suspended (see section 46-2).

            (2)  However, the approved provider is not eligible for * community care subsidy if the * community care agreement is excluded on that day because the approved provider exceeds the approved provider s allocation of * places for community care subsidy (see section 46-3).

Note:          Eligibility may also be affected by Division 7 (relating to a person s approval as a provider of * aged care services) or Division 20 (relating to a person s approval as a recipient of community care).

##### <a id="46-2"></a>46-2  Suspension of community care services

            (1)  A care recipient who is being provided with community care by an approved provider in accordance with a * community care agreement may request the approved provider to suspend, on a temporary basis, the provision of that community care, commencing on a date specified in the request.

                             (i)  on each day of any period during which the care recipient attends a hospital for the purpose of receiving hospital treatment; and

                            (ii)  on each day of any period during which the care recipient is provided with care (other than by the approved provider) of a type, and at a level, specified in the Community Care Subsidy Principles; and

                           (iii)  on each day of any other period specified in the Community Care Subsidy Principles as a period during which a care recipient is to be taken to be provided with community care for the purposes of this section.

            (4)  The Community Care Subsidy Principles may specify a maximum number of days, in respect of each period or all periods referred to in subsection (3), for which a care recipient may be taken to have been provided with community care under that subsection during a particular year.

Note:          If a care recipient is taken not to have been provided with care because the maximum number of days has been exceeded, subsidy will not be payable in respect of those days. However, it would be open to the care recipient to agree, in accordance with paragraph 61-1(1)(e), to pay a fee to the approved provider to reserve the care recipient s place in the service. 

            (5)  In working out the days on which the provision of community care is suspended under this section:

                     (b)  the Secretary decides, in accordance with subsection (2), that the community care agreement is to be excluded on that day.

            (2)  In deciding under paragraph (1)(b) which * community care agreements are to be excluded, the Secretary must:

                     (a)  make the number of exclusions necessary to ensure that the number of * places for which * community care subsidy will be payable does not exceed the number of places included in the approved provider s allocation of places for community care subsidy; and

                     (b)  exclude the community care agreements in the reverse order in which the care recipients in question * entered the community care service for the provision of community care.

#### Subdivision 57-D - Amounts of accommodation bonds

##### <a id="57-12"></a>57-12  Maximum amount of accommodation bond

            (1)  Subject to subsection (2) and sections 57-13 and 57-14, the maximum amount of an * accommodation bond for the * entry of a person as a care recipient to a residential care service or flexible care service is whichever is the lowest of the following:

                     (a)  the amount of the accommodation bond specified in the * accommodation bond agreement;

                     (b)  an amount that, when subtracted from an amount equal to the value of the care recipient s assets at the time of the care recipient s entry to the residential care service or flexible care service, leaves an amount at least equal to the care recipient s minimum permissible asset value (see subsection (3));

                     (c)  such amount as is specified in, or worked out in accordance with, the User Rights Principles.

Note:          The operation of this section may be modified if, before entering an accommodation bond agreement, the care recipient gives the approved provider a determination under section 44-8AB of the value of the care recipient s assets. See subsection (5).

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  a care recipient proposes to * enter a residential care service, or flexible care service, conducted by an approved provider; and

                     (b)  the care recipient does not, before entering an * accommodation bond agreement, give to the approved provider sufficient information about the care recipient s assets for the approved provider to be able to determine the amounts referred to in paragraph (1)(b);

the maximum amount of an * accommodation bond for the entry of the person as a care recipient to the residential care service or flexible care service is the lesser of the amounts referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (c).

            (3)  A care recipient s **_minimum permissible asset value_** is:

                     (a)  if the time (the **_entry time_**) of the care recipient s * entry to the residential care service or flexible care service is before 20 September 2009:

                             (i)  the amount obtained by rounding to the nearest $500.00 (rounding $250.00 upwards) an amount equal to 2.5 times the * basic age pension amount at the entry time; or

                            (ii)  such higher amount as is specified in, or worked out in accordance with, the User Rights Principles; or

                     (b)  if the time (the **_entry time_**) of the care recipient s entry to the residential care service or flexible care service is on or after 20 September 2009:

                             (i)  the amount obtained by rounding to the nearest $500.00 (rounding $250.00 upwards) an amount equal to 2.25 times the * basic age pension amount at the entry time; or

                            (ii)  such higher amount as is specified in, or worked out in accordance with, the User Rights Principles.

            (4)  The value of a care recipient s assets is to be worked out in the same way as it would be worked out under section 44-10 for the purposes of section 44-5B, 44-7 or 44-8.

            (5)  However, subsections (1), (2) and (3) are modified as described in the table, and subsection (4) does not apply, if, before entering the * accommodation bond agreement, the care recipient gives the approved provider a copy of a determination that:

                     (a)  is a determination under section 44-8AB of the value of the care recipient s assets at a time (the **_valuation time_**) that is before or at the time (the **_entry time_**) the care recipient * enters the residential care service or flexible care service; and

                     (b)  is in force at the entry time, if that is after the valuation time.

##### <a id="57-13"></a>57-13  Maximum amount of accommodation bond if care recipient moves between certain aged care services

                   If:

                     (a)  an * accommodation bond has been paid by a care recipient for * entry to an aged care service (the **_original service_**) that is a residential care service or a flexible care service; and

                     (b)  the care recipient ceases being provided with residential care, or flexible care, through the original service (other than because the care recipient is on * leave); and

                     (c)  the care recipient enters another aged care service that is a residential care service or a flexible care service within 28 days after the day on which the care recipient ceased being provided with care by the original service;

the maximum amount of the accommodation bond for the entry of the care recipient to the other service is the amount of the accommodation bond balance that was refunded or is payable to the care recipient under section 57-21 in respect of the accommodation bond referred to in paragraph (a).

##### <a id="57-14"></a>57-14  Accommodation bond in cases of financial hardship

            (1)  The Secretary may determine, in accordance with the User Rights Principles, that a person:

                     (a)  must not be charged an * accommodation bond because payment of an accommodation bond would cause the person financial hardship; or

                     (b)  must not be charged an accommodation bond of more than a specified maximum amount because payment of more than that amount would cause the person financial hardship.

Note:          Refusals to make determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (2)  Without limiting the circumstances that constitute financial hardship for the purposes of this section, such circumstances include any circumstances specified in the User Rights Principles.

            (3)  The determination ceases to be in force at the end of a specified period or on the occurrence of a specified event, if the determination so provides.

Note:          Decisions to specify periods or events are reviewable under Part 6.1.

            (4)  Application may be made to the Secretary, in the form approved by the Secretary, for a determination under subsection (1) that payment of an * accommodation bond, or an accommodation bond of more than a specified maximum amount, would cause the person financial hardship. The application may be made by:

                     (a)  the person; or

                     (b)  an approved provider to which the accommodation bond, or a larger accommodation bond, would otherwise be paid.

(5)  If the Secretary needs further information to determine the application, the Secretary may give to the applicant a notice requiring the applicant to give the further information:

                     (a)  within 28 days after receiving the notice; or 

                     (b)  within such other period as is specified in the notice.

The application is taken to have been withdrawn if the information is not given within whichever of those periods applies. The notice must contain a statement setting out the effect of this subsection.

Note:          The period for giving the further information can be extended - see section 96-7.

            (6)  The Secretary must notify the person and the approved provider, in writing, of the Secretary s decision on whether to make the determination. The notice must be given:

                     (a)  within 28 days after receiving the application; or

                     (b)  if the Secretary has requested further information under subsection (5) - within 28 days after receiving the information.

            (7)  If the Secretary makes a determination, the notice must:

                     (a)  set out any period at the end of which, or any event on the occurrence of which, the determination will cease to be in force; and

                     (b)  if the determination is that a person must not be charged an * accommodation bond of more than a specified maximum amount - specify the maximum amount of the accommodation bond.

##### <a id="57-15"></a>57-15  Revocation of determinations of financial hardship

            (1)  The Secretary may, in accordance with the User Rights Principles, revoke a determination made under section 57-14.

Note:          Revocations of determinations are reviewable under Part 6.1.

(2)Before deciding to revoke the determination, the Secretary must notify the person, and an approved provider who is providing or is to provide residential care or flexible care to the person, that revocation is being considered. The notice must be in writing and must:

                     (a)  invite the person and the approved provider to make submissions, in writing, to the Secretary within 28 days after receiving the notice; and

                     (b)  inform them that if no submissions are made within that period, the revocation takes effect on the day after the last day for making submissions.

(3)In making the decision whether to revoke the determination, the Secretary must consider any submissions received within the period for making submissions. The Secretary must make the decision within 28 days after the end of that period.

(4)  The Secretary must notify, in writing, the person and the approved provider of the decision.

            (5)  The notice must be given to the person and the approved provider within 28 days after the end of the period for making submissions. If the notice is not given within that period, the Secretary is taken to have decided not to revoke the determination.

(6)A revocation has effect:

                     (a)  if the person and the approved provider received notice under subsection (4) on the same day - the day after that day; or

                     (b)  if they received the notice on different days - the day after the later of those days.

#### Subdivision 57-E - Payment of accommodation bonds

##### <a id="57-16"></a>57-16  Period for payment of accommodation bond

            (1)  A care recipient must not be required to pay an * accommodation bond:

                     (a)  before the end of such period as is specified in the User Rights Principles; or

                     (b)  if no period is specified - before the end of 6 months;

after * entry to the residential care service or flexible care service.

            (2)  If the care recipient has entered a residential care service and the residential care service was not * certified at the time of the care recipient s * entry to the service, the care recipient must not be required to pay the * accommodation bond:

                     (a)  before the end of such period as is specified in the User Rights Principles; or

                     (b)  if no period is specified - before the end of 6 months;

following the certification of the residential care service.

Note 1:       However, under sections 57-18 and 57-20, amounts representing income derived and retention amounts are payable from:

(a)             the date a care recipient * enters a residential care service that is * certified or a flexible care service; or

(b)             the date on which a residential care service is certified, if it was not certified at the time a care recipient entered it.

Note 2:       Paragraph 57-2(1)(e) in most cases requires the * accommodation bond agreement to have been entered into before, or within 21 days after, the care recipient s * entry to the service - this applies even if the care recipient has entered a residential care service that was not * certified at the time of the care recipient s entry to the service.

##### <a id="57-17"></a>57-17  Payment of an accommodation bond by periodic payments

            (1)  A care recipient may elect that an * accommodation bond is to be paid, in whole or in part, by periodic payments.

            (2)  The User Rights Principles may specify:

                     (a)  the frequency of periodic payments; and

                     (b)  the method for working out amounts of periodic payments (including a method where only part of the * accommodation bond is to be paid by periodic payments); and

                     (c)  any other matters relating to periodic payments.

            (3)  The method specified in the User Rights Principles for working out amounts of periodic payments must have regard to:

                     (a)  the income that the approved provider could be expected to have derived; and

                     (b)  the retention amounts that would have been permitted to be deducted under section 57-20;

if the * accommodation bond had been paid as a lump sum.

#### Subdivision 57-F - Rights of approved providers

##### <a id="57-18"></a>57-18  Approved provider may retain income derived

            (1)  An approved provider may retain income derived from the investment of an * accommodation bond balance in respect of an * accommodation bond paid to the approved provider.

            (2)  Despite section 57-16, if a care recipient pays an * accommodation bond to an approved provider after the due date (see subsection (6)), the care recipient may be required to pay to the approved provider an amount representing the income the approved provider could be expected to have derived, through investing the * accommodation bond balance, during the period:

                     (a)  beginning on the due date; and

                     (b)  ending on the day on which the * accommodation bond was paid.

            (3)  If the care recipient is provided with care for 2 months or less, the care recipient may be required to pay to the approved provider an amount representing the income the approved provider could be expected to have derived, through investing the * accommodation bond balance, during:

                     (a)  the whole of the month in which the care recipient * entered the residential care service or flexible care service; and 

                     (b)  the 2 following months;

unless the User Rights Principles specify that a lesser amount is payable. 

Example:    If a care recipient * entered a residential care service on 20 January and left on 3 March, the amount would be the amount the approved provider could have been expected to have derived if the care recipient received care for the whole of January, February and March.

            (4)  The User Rights Principles may specify a method for working out the amounts referred to in subsections (2) and (3).

            (5)  The User Rights Principles may provide that, in the circumstances specified in the User Rights Principles, an approved provider must not retain income derived, from the investment of an * accommodation bond balance, in respect of periods specified in the User Rights Principles.

            (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="due-date"></a>**_due date_** means:

                     (a)  in relation to an * accommodation bond payable by a care recipient for * entry to a residential care service - whichever of the following days is applicable:

                             (i)  the day on which the care recipient entered the residential care service;

                            (ii)  if the residential care service was not * certified on that day - the day on which the residential care service was certified; or

                     (b)  in relation to an accommodation bond payable by a care recipient for entry to a flexible care service - the day on which the care recipient entered the flexible care service.

##### <a id="57-19"></a>57-19  Amounts to be deducted from accommodation bond balance

            (1)  An approved provider to whom an * accommodation bond was paid by a care recipient may deduct from the * accommodation bond balance:

                     (a)  retention amounts in respect of the accommodation bond (see section 57-20); and

                     (b)  amounts owed to the approved provider by the care recipient under an * accommodation bond agreement, a * resident agreement or an * extra service agreement; and

                     (c)  amounts, worked out in accordance with the User Rights Principles, representing interest on the amounts referred to in paragraph (b).

            (2)  The approved provider must not deduct any other amounts from the * accommodation bond balance.

##### <a id="57-20"></a>57-20  Retention amounts

            (1)  A retention amount must not exceed the amount specified in, or worked out in accordance with, the User Rights Principles.

            (2)  The User Rights Principles may provide that, in the circumstances specified in the User Rights Principles, an approved provider must not deduct any amounts from an * accommodation bond balance in respect of periods specified in the User Rights Principles.

            (3)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a retention amount may be deducted from an * accommodation bond balance for each month, or part of a month, during which the care recipient concerned is:

                     (a)  provided with residential care through the residential care service in respect of which the * accommodation bond was paid; or

                     (b)  provided with flexible care through the flexible care service in respect of which the accommodation bond was paid.

            (4)  Subject to subsection (5), retention amounts may only be deducted during the period of 5 years, or such other period specified in the User Rights Principles, starting on the latest of the following days:

                     (a)  the day on which the care recipient * entered the residential care service or flexible care service;

                     (b)  if the service is a residential care service and is not * certified on that day - the day on which the service became certified;

                     (c)  if a determination under paragraph 57-14(1)(a) is in force in respect of the care recipient - the day after the day on which the determination ceases to be in force;

                     (d)  such other day as is worked out in accordance with the User Rights Principles.

            (5)  If, before the * accommodation bond was paid, amounts had already been deducted from an * accommodation bond balance in respect of another accommodation bond previously paid by the care recipient, the period of 5 years referred to in subsection (4) is reduced by each month in respect of which a retention amount was so deducted.

Note:          The effect of this subsection is that all periods spent in residential care or flexible care after an * accommodation bond is first paid will count towards the 5 year maximum under subsection (4) for deducting retention amounts.

Example:    If a care recipient initially spends 6 weeks in residential care and then moves to another residential care service, retention amounts can be deducted for 3 months in respect of the 6 weeks of care (see subsection (6)), but after that only for up to 4 years and 9 months.

            (6)  For the purposes of this section, if the care recipient is provided with care for 2 months or less, the care recipient is taken, for the purposes of working out retention amounts payable, to have received that care during:

                     (a)  the whole of the month in which the care recipient * entered the residential care service or flexible care service; and 

                     (b)  the 2 following months;

unless the User Rights Principles specify that care is taken to have been provided for a shorter period.

Example:    A care recipient who * entered a residential care service on 20 January and left on 3 March would be taken to have received care for the whole of January, February and March. Therefore, retention amounts could be deducted for each of these months.

            (7)  Deduction of retention amounts must comply with any other requirements specified in the User Rights Principles.

#### Subdivision 57-G - Refunds

##### <a id="57-21"></a>57-21  Refunding of accommodation bond balance - approved providers

                             (i)  if the care recipient has notified the approved provider of the move more than 14 days before the day on which the approved provider ceased providing care to the care recipient - on the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care; or

                            (ii)  if the care recipient so notified the approved provider within 14 days before the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care - within 14 days after the day on which the notice was given; or

                           (iii)  if the care recipient did not notify the approved provider before the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care - within 14 days after the day on which the approved provider ceased providing that care; or

#### Subdivision 57-H - Charging an accommodation bond instead of an accommodation charge

##### <a id="57-23"></a>57-23  Charging an accommodation bond instead of an accommodation charge

            (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a care recipient has entered into an * accommodation bond agreement (the **_original agreement_**) for * entry to an aged care service (the **_original service_**) that is a residential care service or a flexible care service; and

                     (b)  the care recipient ceases being provided with residential care or flexible care through the original service (other than because the care recipient is on * leave); and

                     (c)  within 28 days after the cessation, the care recipient enters another aged care service (the **_later service_**) that is a residential care service or a flexible care service and for which entry an * accommodation charge would become payable (disregarding subparagraph 57A-2(1)(a)(iv)); and

                     (d)  the approved provider of the later service and the care recipient agreed, before the care recipient entered the later service, that an accommodation bond, instead of an accommodation charge, can be charged for the entry of the person to the later service.

            (2)  If this section applies:

                     (a)  the approved provider of the later service can charge an * accommodation bond for the * entry of the person to the later service; and

                     (b)  if the care recipient has paid the full amount of the accommodation bond relating to the original agreement - the maximum amount of the new accommodation bond is the amount of the accommodation bond balance that was refunded or is payable to the care recipient under section 57-21 in respect of the accommodation bond relating to the original agreement; and

                     (c)  in any other case - the maximum amount of the new accommodation bond is the amount of the accommodation bond that was payable under the original agreement, less any retention amounts that would have been permitted to be deducted under section 57-20 in respect of the original service if the accommodation bond had been paid as a lump sum.

##### <a id="57A-3"></a>57A-3  Contents of accommodation charge agreements

            (1)  An agreement between an approved provider and a person proposing to * enter, or having entered, as a care recipient to a residential care service through which the approved provider provides care is an **_accommodation charge agreement_** if it sets out the following:

                     (a)  the amount of the * accommodation charge that:

                             (i)  will accrue for each day (including a day on which the care recipient is on * leave from the residential care service) if the care recipient enters the service; or

                            (ii)  if the care recipient has already entered the residential care service - has accrued and will accrue for each day (including a day on which the care recipient is on * leave from the service); 

                     (b)  the care recipient s proposed date of entry, or date of entry, to the residential care service;

                     (c)  how the accommodation charge is to be paid;

                     (d)  the time or times when the accommodation charge is payable;

                     (e)  whether agreeing to pay the accommodation charge entitles the care recipient to specific accommodation or additional services within the residential care service;

                      (f)  any financial hardship provisions that apply to the care recipient;

                     (g)  such other matters as are specified in the User Rights Principles.

Example:    These provisions may be included in a * resident agreement.

##### <a id="57A-5"></a>57A-5  Agreements cannot affect requirements of this Division

                   The requirements of this Division apply despite any provision of an * accommodation charge agreement, or any other agreement, to the contrary.

#### Subdivision 57A-C - Daily accrual amounts of accommodation charges

##### <a id="57A-6"></a>57A-6  Maximum daily accrual amount of accommodation charge

            (1)  Subject to subsection (2) and sections 57A-8A and 57A-9, the maximum daily amount at which an * accommodation charge accrues for the * entry of a person as a care recipient to a residential care service is whichever is the lowest of the following:

                     (a)  the amount of the daily accrual of the accommodation charge as specified in the * accommodation charge agreement;

                     (b)  the amount (rounded down to the nearest cent) obtained by:

                             (i)  taking the amount that, when subtracted from an amount equal to the value of the care recipient s assets at the time of the care recipient s entry to the residential care service, leaves an amount at least equal to the care recipient s minimum permissible asset value as defined in subsection 57-12(3); and

                            (ii)  dividing the result by 2,080;

                     (c)  such amount as is specified in, or worked out in accordance with, the User Rights Principles.

Note:          The operation of this section may be modified if, before entering into an accommodation charge agreement, the care recipient gives the approved provider a determination under section 44-8AB of the value of the care recipient s assets. See subsection (4).

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  a care recipient proposes to * enter a residential care service conducted by an approved provider; and

                     (b)  the care recipient does not, before entering into an * accommodation charge agreement, give the approved provider sufficient information about the care recipient s assets for the approved provider to be able to determine the amounts referred to in paragraph (1)(b);

            (3)  The value of a care recipient s assets is to be worked out in the same way as it would be worked out under section 44-10 for the purposes of section 44-5B, 44-7 or 44-8.

            (4)  However, subsections (1) and (2) are modified as described in the table, and subsection (3) does not apply, if, before entering into the * accommodation charge agreement, the care recipient gives the approved provider a copy of a determination that:

                     (a)  is a determination under section 44-8AB of the value of the care recipient s assets at a time (the **_valuation time_**) that is before or at the time (the **_entry time_**) the care recipient * enters the residential care service; and

                     (b)  is in force at the entry time, if that is after the valuation time.

##### <a id="58-2"></a>58-2  Maximum daily amount of resident fees

                   The maximum daily amount of resident fees payable by the care recipient is the amount worked out as follows:

* * *

**Resident fee calculator**

Step 1\. Work out the * standard resident contribution for the care recipient using section 58-3, 58-3B, 58-3C or 58-4 (whichever is applicable).

Step 2\. Add the compensation payment reduction (if any) applicable to the care recipient on the day in question (see section 44-20).

Step 3.   Add the * daily income tested reduction (if any) applicable to the care recipient on that day (see sections 44-21 to 44-23).

Step 4.   Subtract the amount of any hardship supplement (expressed as a daily amount) applicable to the care recipient on the day in question under section 44-30.

Step 5.   Add any other amounts agreed between the care recipient and the approved provider in accordance with the User Rights Principles.

Step 6.   If, on the day in question, the * place in respect of which residential care is provided to the care recipient has * extra service status, add the extra service amount in respect of the place worked out under section 58-5\. 

The result is the **_maximum daily amount of resident fees_** for the care recipient.

            (1)  This section sets out the responsibilities of an approved provider of residential care relating to an allegation or suspicion of a * reportable assault (see subsection (9)).

Reporting reportable assaults

            (2)  If the approved provider receives an allegation of, or starts to suspect on reasonable grounds, a * reportable assault, the approved provider is responsible for reporting the allegation or suspicion as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case within 24 hours, to:

                     (b)  makes a disclosure that qualifies for protection under section 96-8.

Note 1:       Under section 96-8, some disclosures of information qualify for protection if they are made by a staff member of an approved provider and the member has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information indicates that a reportable assault has occurred.

Note 2:       The responsibility under subsection (6) covers not only compliance by the approved provider itself with the relevant provisions of section 96-8, but extends to the approved provider ensuring as far as reasonably practicable that there is also compliance by others, such as:

(a)             other staff members of the approved provider; and

(b)             other parties with whom the approved provider contracts (for example, an employment agency).

Protecting informants  identities

                     (a)  * key personnel; or

                     (b)  staff members authorised by the provider to receive reports of suspected reportable assaults;

the provider is responsible for taking reasonable measures to ensure that the report recipient does not disclose the fact that the person was the maker of the report, except to the provider or a person described in paragraph (7)(a), (b), (c) or (d).
