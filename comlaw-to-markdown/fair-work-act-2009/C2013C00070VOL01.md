### Division 2 - Object of this Act

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Object of this Act

                   The object of this Act is to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations that promotes national economic prosperity and social inclusion for all Australians by:

                     (a)  providing workplace relations laws that are fair to working Australians, are flexible for businesses, promote productivity and economic growth for Australia s future economic prosperity and take into account Australia s international labour obligations; and

                     (b)  ensuring a guaranteed safety net of fair, relevant and enforceable minimum terms and conditions through the National Employment Standards, modern awards and national minimum wage orders; and

                     (c)  ensuring that the guaranteed safety net of fair, relevant and enforceable minimum wages and conditions can no longer be undermined by the making of statutory individual employment agreements of any kind given that such agreements can never be part of a fair workplace relations system; and

                     (d)  assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities by providing for flexible working arrangements; and

                     (e)  enabling fairness and representation at work and the prevention of discrimination by recognising the right to freedom of association and the right to be represented, protecting against unfair treatment and discrimination, providing accessible and effective procedures to resolve grievances and disputes and providing effective compliance mechanisms; and

                      (f)  achieving productivity and fairness through an emphasis on enterprise-level collective bargaining underpinned by simple good faith bargaining obligations and clear rules governing industrial action; and

                     (g)  acknowledging the special circumstances of small and medium-sized businesses.

### Division 3 - Guide to this Act

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Guide to this Act

Overview of this Act

            (1)  This Act is about workplace relations. It:

                     (a)  provides for terms and conditions of employment (Chapter 2); and

                     (b)  sets out rights and responsibilities of employees, employers and organisations in relation to that employment (Chapter 3); and

                     (c)  provides for compliance with, and enforcement of, this Act (Chapter 4); and

                     (d)  provides for the administration of this Act by establishing the Fair Work Commission and the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman (Chapter 5); and

                     (e)  deals with other matters relating to the above (Chapter 6).

Overview of the rest of this Chapter

            (2)  The rest of this Chapter deals with:

                     (a)  definitions that are used in this Act (Part 1-2); and

                     (b)  the application of this Act (Part 1-3), including how this Act interacts with certain State and Territory laws and its geographical application.

Definitions

            (3)  Many of the terms in this Act are defined. The Dictionary in section 12 contains a list of every term that is defined in this Act.

Application, saving and transitional provisions for amendments

            (4)  Schedule 1 contains application, saving and transitional provisions relating to amendments of this Act.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Terms and conditions of employment (Chapter 2)

            (1)  Chapter 2 provides for terms and conditions of employment of national system employees.

            (2)  Part 2-1 has the core provisions for the Chapter. It deals with compliance with, and interaction between, the sources of the main terms and conditions provided under this Act - the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.

Note:          Workplace determinations are another source of main terms and conditions. In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279).

Main terms and conditions

            (3)  Part 2-2 contains the National Employment Standards, which are minimum terms and conditions that apply to all national system employees.

            (4)  Part 2-3 is about modern awards. A modern award is made for a particular industry or occupation and provides additional minimum terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. A modern award can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.

            (5)  Part 2-4 is about enterprise agreements. An enterprise agreement is made at the enterprise level and provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. An enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.

            (6)  Part 2-5 is about workplace determinations. A workplace determination provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. A workplace determination is made by the FWC if certain conditions are met.

            (7)  Part 2-8 provides for the transfer of certain modern awards, enterprise agreements, workplace determinations and other instruments if there is a transfer of business from one national system employer to another national system employer.

Other terms and conditions

            (8)  In addition, other terms and conditions of employment for national system employees include those:

                     (a)  provided by a national minimum wage order (see Part 2-6) or an equal remuneration order (see Part 2-7); and

                     (b)  provided by Part 2-9 (which deals with the frequency and method of making payments to employees, deductions from payments and high-income employees).

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Rights and responsibilities of employees, employers, organisations etc. (Chapter 3)

            (1)  Chapter 3 sets out rights and responsibilities of national system employees, national system employers, organisations and others (such as independent contractors and industrial associations).

            (2)  Part 3-1 provides general workplace protections. It:

                     (a)  protects workplace rights; and

                     (b)  protects freedom of association and involvement in lawful industrial activities; and

                     (c)  provides other protections, including protection from discrimination.

            (3)  Part 3-2 deals with unfair dismissal of national system employees, and the granting of remedies when that happens.

            (4)  Part 3-3 deals mainly with industrial action by national system employees and national system employers and sets out when industrial action is protected industrial action. No action lies under any law in force in a State or Territory in relation to protected industrial action except in certain circumstances.

            (5)  Part 3-4 is about the rights of officials of organisations who hold entry permits to enter premises for purposes related to their representative role under this Act and under State or Territory OHS laws. In exercising those rights, permit holders must comply with the requirements set out in the Part.

            (6)  Part 3-5 allows a national system employer to stand down a national system employee without pay in certain circumstances.

            (7)  Part 3-6 deals with other rights and responsibilities of national system employers in relation to:

                     (a)  termination of employment; and

                     (b)  keeping records and giving payslips.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Compliance and enforcement (Chapter 4)

            (1)  Chapter 4 provides for compliance with, and enforcement of, this Act.

            (2)  Part 4-1 is about civil remedies. Certain provisions in this Act impose obligations on certain persons. Civil remedies may be sought in relation to contraventions of these civil remedy provisions. Part 4-1:

                     (a)  deals with applications for orders for contraventions of civil remedy provisions; and

                     (b)  sets out the orders the courts can make in relation to a contravention of a civil remedy provision.

            (3)  Part 4-2 is about the jurisdiction and powers of the courts in relation to matters arising under this Act.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Administration (Chapter 5)

            (1)  Chapter 5 provides for the administration of this Act by establishing the Fair Work Commission and the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman.

            (2)  Part 5-1 is about the Fair Work Commission. It:

                     (a)  establishes and confers functions on the FWC; and

                     (b)  sets out how matters before the FWC are to be conducted (for example, how the FWC is to deal with applications made to it).

            (3)  Part 5-2 is about the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. It:

                     (a)  establishes and confers functions on the Fair Work Ombudsman; and

            (1)  Chapter 6 is a collection of miscellaneous matters that relate to the other Chapters.

            (3)  Part 6-2 is about dealing with disputes between national system employees and their employers under modern awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment.

            (4)  Part 6-3 extends the National Employment Standards relating to unpaid parental leave and notice of termination to non-national system employees.

          (4A)  Part 6-3A provides for the transfer of terms and conditions of employment that are provided for in particular State industrial instruments if there is a transfer of business from a non-national system employer that is a State public sector employer of the State to a national system employer.

            (5)  Part 6-4 contains provisions to give effect, or further effect, to certain international agreements relating to termination of employment.

          (5A)  Part 6-4A contains special provisions about TCF outworkers.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Meaning of _ordinary hours of work_ for award/agreement free employees

Agreed ordinary hours of work

                     (c)  an award/agreement free employee who is in a class of employees prescribed by the regulations as pieceworkers.

Note:          Sections 197 and 198 affect whether the FWC may approve an enterprise agreement covering a national system employee that includes a term that:

(b)    does not define or describe the employee as a pieceworker, if the employee is covered by a modern award that is in operation and includes such a term.

            (2)  Without limiting the way in which a class may be described for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the class may be described by reference to one or more of the following:

General meaning

            (1)  A period of **_service_** by a national system employee with his or her national system employer is a period during which the employee is employed by the employer, but does not include any period (an **_excluded period_**) that does not count as service because of subsection (2).

                     (a)  any period of unauthorised absence;

                     (b)  any period of unpaid leave or unpaid authorised absence, other than:

                           (iii)  a period of leave or absence of a kind prescribed by the regulations;

                     (c)  any other period of a kind prescribed by the regulations.

            (3)  An excluded period does not break a national system employee s **_continuous service_**with his or her national system employer, but does not count towards the length of the employee s continuous service.

          (3A)  Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) may prescribe different kinds of periods for the purposes of different provisions of this Act (other than provisions to which subsection (4) applies). If they do so, subsection (3) applies accordingly.

Meaning for Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 2-2

            (4)  For the purposes of Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 2-2:

                     (a)  a period of **_service_** by a national system employee with his or her national system employer is a period during which the employee is employed by the employer, but does not include:

                             (i)  any period of unauthorised absence; or

                            (ii)  any other period of a kind prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (b)  a period referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) does not break a national system employee s **_continuous service_**with his or her national system employer, but does not count towards the length of the employee s continuous service; and

                     (c)  subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply.

Note:           Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 2-2 deal, respectively, with requests for flexible working arrangements, parental leave and related entitlements, and notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice.

          (4A)  Regulations made for the purposes of subparagraph (4)(a)(ii) may prescribe different kinds of periods for the purposes of different provisions to which subsection (4) applies. If they do so, paragraph (4)(b) applies accordingly.

When service with one employer counts as service with another employer

            (5)  If there is a transfer of employment (see subsection (7)) in relation to a national system employee:

                     (a)  any period of service of the employee with the first employer counts as service of the employee with the second employer; and

                     (b)  the period between the termination of the employment with the first employer and the start of the employment with the second employer does not break the employee s continuous service with the second employer (taking account of the effect of paragraph (a)), but does not count towards the length of the employee s continuous service with the second employer.

Note:          This subsection does not apply to a transfer of employment between non-associated entities, for the purpose of Division 6 of Part 2-2 (which deals with annual leave) or Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part 2-2 (which deals with redundancy pay), if the second employer decides not to recognise the employee s service with the first employer for the purpose of that Division or Subdivision (see subsections 91(1) and 122(1)).

            (6)  If the national system employee has already had the benefit of an entitlement the amount of which was calculated by reference to a period of service with the first employer, subsection (5) does not result in that period of service with the first employer being counted again when calculating the employee s entitlements of that kind as an employee of the second employer.

Note:          For example:

(a)     the accrued paid annual leave to which the employee is entitled as an employee of the second employer does not include any period of paid annual leave that the employee has already taken as an employee of the first employer; and

(b)    if an employee receives notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice in relation to a period of service with the first employer, that period of service is not counted again in calculating the amount of notice of termination, or payment in lieu, to which the employee is entitled as an employee of the second employer.

Meaning of **transfer of employment** etc.

            (7)  There is a **_transfer of employment_** of a national system employee from one national system employer (the **_first employer_**) to another national system employer (the **_second employer_**) if:

                     (a)  the following conditions are satisfied:

                             (i)  the employee becomes employed by the second employer not more than 3 months after the termination of the employee s employment with the first employer;

                            (ii)  the first employer and the second employer are associated entities when the employee becomes employed by the second employer; or

                     (b)  the following conditions are satisfied:

                             (i)  the employee is a transferring employee in relation to a transfer of business from the first employer to the second employer;

                            (ii)  the first employer and the second employer are not associated entities when the employee becomes employed by the second employer.

Note:          Paragraph (a) applies whether or not there is a transfer of business from the first employer to the second employer.

            (8)  A transfer of employment:

                     (a)  is a **_transfer of employment between associated entities_** if paragraph (7)(a) applies; and

                     (b)  is a **_transfer of employment between non-associated entities_** if paragraph (7)(b) applies.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Meaning of _small business employer_

            (1)  A national system employer is a **_small business employer_** at a particular time if the employer employs fewer than 15 employees at that time.

            (2)  For the purpose of calculating the number of employees employed by the employer at a particular time:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b), all employees employed by the employer at that time are to be counted; and

                     (b)  a casual employee is not to be counted unless, at that time, he or she has been employed by the employer on a regular and systematic basis.

            (3)  For the purpose of calculating the number of employees employed by the employer at a particular time, associated entities are taken to be one entity.

            (4)  To avoid doubt, in determining whether a national system employer is a **_small business_**_employer_ at a particular time in relation to the dismissal of an employee, or termination of an employee s employment, the employees that are to be counted include (subject to paragraph (2)(b)):

                     (a)  the employee who is being dismissed or whose employment is being terminated; and

                     (b)  any other employee of the employer who is also being dismissed or whose employment is also being terminated.

            (2)  An **_Australian-based employee_** is an employee:

                     (a)  whose primary place of work is in Australia; or

                     (b)  who is employed by an Australian employer (whether the employee is located in Australia or elsewhere); or

            (3)  However, paragraph (2)(b) does not apply to an employee who is engaged outside Australia and the external Territories to perform duties outside Australia and the external Territories.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Act not to apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power

            (1)  Unless the contrary intention appears, if a provision of this Act:

                     (a)  would, apart from this section, have an application (an **_invalid application_**) in relation to:

                             (i)  one or more particular persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases; or

                            (ii)  one or more classes (however defined or determined) of persons, things, matters, places, circumstances or cases;

                           because of which the provision exceeds the Commonwealth s legislative power; and

                     (a)  apart from this section, it is clear, taking into account the provision s context and the purpose or object underlying this Act, that the provision was intended to have that valid application only if every invalid application, or a particular invalid application, of the provision had also been within the Commonwealth s legislative power; or

                     (b)  the provision s operation in relation to that valid application would be different in a substantial respect from what would have been its operation in relation to that valid application if every invalid application of the provision had been within the Commonwealth s legislative power.

            (1)  A public sector employment law prevails over a fair work instrument that deals with public sector employment, to the extent of any inconsistency.

When fair work instruments or their terms prevail

            (2)  However, a fair work instrument, or a term of a fair work instrument, that deals with public sector employment prevails over a public sector employment law, to the extent of any inconsistency, if:

                     (b)  the instrument or term (other than an FWC order or a term of an FWC order) is included in a class of instruments or terms that are prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of that particular law.

Laws that fair work instruments never prevail over

# Chapter 2 - Terms and conditions of employment

## Part 2-1 - Core provisions for this Chapter

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part has the core provisions for this Chapter, which deals with terms and conditions of employment of national system employees. The main terms and conditions come from the National Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations.

The National Employment Standards (Part 2-2) are minimum terms and conditions that apply to all national system employees.

A modern award (see Part 2-3), an enterprise agreement (see Part 2-4) or a workplace determination (see Part 2-5) provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom the award, agreement or determination applies. Only one of those instruments can apply to an employee at a particular time.

Division 2 has the provisions to enforce the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements. It also sets out when a modern award or enterprise agreement applies to a person and the significance of that for this Act.

                     Note:             In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279). For the rules about workplace determinations, see Part 2-5.

Division 3 deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.

* * *

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

                   In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

Note:          See also Division 2 of Part 6-4A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

### Division 2 - Core provisions for this Chapter

#### Subdivision A - Terms and conditions of employment provided under this Act

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Terms and conditions of employment provided under this Act

Main terms and conditions

            (1)  The main terms and conditions of employment of an employee that are provided under this Act are those set out in:

                     (a)  the National Employment Standards (see Part 2-2); and

                     (b)  a modern award (see Part 2-3), an enterprise agreement (see Part 2-4) or a workplace determination (see Part 2-5) that applies to the employee.

Note 1:       The situations in which a workplace determination, rather than a modern award or enterprise agreement, provides an employee s terms and conditions of employment are limited. In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279). See Part 2-5 generally for the rules on workplace determinations.

Note 2:       Part 2-8 provides for the transfer of certain modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations if there is a transfer of business from an employee s employer to another employer.

Note 3:       Copied State instruments provide the main terms and conditions of employment for an employee to whom the instrument applies. See Part 6-3A generally for the rules about those instruments.

Other terms and conditions

            (2)  In addition, other terms and conditions of employment include:

                     (a)  those terms and conditions arising from:

                             (i)  a national minimum wage order (see Part 2-6); or

                            (ii)  an equal remuneration order (see Part 2-7); and

                     (b)  those terms and conditions provided by Part 2-9.

Note:          Part 2-9 deals with miscellaneous terms and conditions of employment, such as payment of wages.

#### Subdivision B - Terms and conditions of employment provided by the National Employment Standards

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Contravening the National Employment Standards

            (1)  An employer must not contravene a provision of the National Employment Standards.

Note:          This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

            (2)  However, an order cannot be made under Division 2 of Part 4-1 in relation to a contravention (or alleged contravention) of subsection 65(5) or 76(4).

Note 1:       Subsections 65(5) and 76(4) state that an employer may refuse a request for flexible working arrangements, or an application to extend unpaid parental leave, only on reasonable business grounds.

Note 2:       Modern awards and enterprise agreements include terms about settling disputes in relation to the National Employment Standards (other than disputes as to whether an employer had reasonable business grounds under subsection 65(5) or 76(4)).

#### Subdivision C - Terms and conditions of employment provided by a modern award

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Contravening a modern award

                   A person must not contravene a term of a modern award.

Note 1:       This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       A person does not contravene a term of a modern award unless the award applies to the person: see subsection 46(1).

##### <a id="46"></a>46  The significance of a modern award applying to a person

            (1)  A modern award does not impose obligations on a person, and a person does not contravene a term of a modern award, unless the award applies to the person.

            (2)  A modern award does not give a person an entitlement unless the award applies to the person.

Note:          Subsection (2) does not affect the ability of outworker terms in a modern award to be enforced under Part 4-1 in relation to outworkers who are not employees.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  When a modern award _applies_ to an employer, employee, organisation or outworker entity

When a modern award **applies** to an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity

            (1)  A modern award **_applies_** to an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity if:

                     (a)  the modern award covers the employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity; and

                     (b)  the modern award is in operation; and

                     (c)  no other provision of this Act provides, or has the effect, that the modern award does not apply to the employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity.

Note 1:       Section 57 provides that a modern award does not apply to an employee (or to an employer, or an employee organisation, in relation to the employee) in relation to particular employment at a time when an enterprise agreement applies to the employee in relation to that employment.

Note 2:       In a modern award, coverage of an outworker entity must be expressed to relate only to outworker terms: see subsection 143(4).

Modern awards do not apply to high income employees

            (2)  However, a modern award does not apply to an employee (or to an employer, or an employee organisation, in relation to the employee) at a time when the employee is a high income employee.

Modern awards apply to employees in relation to particular employment

            (3)  A reference in this Act to a modern award applying to an employee is a reference to the award applying to the employee in relation to particular employment.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  When a modern award _covers_ an employer, employee, organisation or outworker entity

When a modern award **covers** an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity

            (1)  A modern award **_covers_** an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity if the award is expressed to cover  the employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity.

Note:          In a modern award, coverage of an outworker entity must be expressed to relate only to outworker terms: see subsection 143(4).

Effect of other provisions of this Act, FWC orders or court orders on coverage

            (2)  A modern award also **_covers_** an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity if any of the following provides, or has the effect, that the award covers the employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity:

                     (a)  a provision of this Act or of the Registered Organisations Act;

                     (b)  an FWC order made under a provision of this Act;

                     (c)  an order of a court.

            (3)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), a modern award does not **_cover_** an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity if any of the following provides, or has the effect, that the award does not cover the employee, employer or organisation or outworker entity:

                     (a)  a provision of this Act;

                     (b)  an FWC order made under a provision of this Act;

                     (c)  an order of a court.

Modern awards that have ceased to operate

            (4)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), a modern award that has ceased to operate does not **_cover_** an employee, employer, organisation or outworker entity.

Modern awards cover employees in relation to particular employment

            (5)  A reference to a modern award covering an employee is a reference to the award covering the employee in relation to particular employment.

When a modern award comes into operation

            (1)  A modern award comes into operation:

                     (a)  on 1 July in the next financial year after it is made; or

                     (b)  if it is made on 1 July in a financial year - on that day.

            (2)  However, if the FWC specifies another day as the day on which the modern award comes into operation, it comes into operation on that other day. The FWC must not specify another day unless it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.

            (3)  The specified day must not be earlier than the day on which the modern award is made.

Note:          For when a State reference public sector modern award comes into operation, see section 168J.

Modern awards operate until revoked

            (7)  A modern award continues in operation until it is revoked.

#### Subdivision D - Terms and conditions of employment provided by an enterprise agreement

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Contravening an enterprise agreement

                   A person must not contravene a term of an enterprise agreement.

Note 1:       This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       A person does not contravene a term of an enterprise agreement unless the agreement applies to the person: see subsection 51(1).

##### <a id="51"></a>51  The significance of an enterprise agreement applying to a person

            (1)  An enterprise agreement does not impose obligations on a person, and a person does not contravene a term of an enterprise agreement, unless the agreement applies to the person.

            (2)  An enterprise agreement does not give a person an entitlement unless the agreement applies to the person.

##### <a id="52"></a>52  When an enterprise agreement _applies_ to an employer, employee or employee organisation

When an enterprise agreement applies to an employee, employer or organisation

            (1)  An enterprise agreement **_applies_** to an employee, employer or employee organisation if:

                     (a)  the agreement is in operation; and

                     (b)  the agreement covers the employee, employer or organisation; and

                     (c)  no other provision of this Act provides, or has the effect, that the agreement does not apply to the employee, employer or organisation.

Enterprise agreements apply to employees in relation to particular employment

            (2)  A reference in this Act to an enterprise agreement applying to an employee is a reference to the agreement applying to the employee in relation to particular employment.

##### <a id="53"></a>53  When an enterprise agreement _covers_ an employer, employee or employee organisation

Employees and employers

            (1)  An enterprise agreement **_covers_** an employee or employer if the agreement is expressed to cover (however described) the employee or the employer.

Employee organisations

            (2)  An enterprise agreement **_covers_** an employee organisation:

                     (a)  for an enterprise agreement that is not a greenfields agreement - if the FWC has noted in its decision to approve the agreement that the agreement covers the organisation (see subsection 201(2)); or

                     (b)  for a greenfields agreement - if the agreement is made by the organisation.

Effect of provisions of this Act, FWC orders and court orders on coverage

            (3)  An enterprise agreement also **_covers_** an employee, employer or employee organisation if any of the following provides, or has the effect, that the agreement covers the employee, employer or organisation:

                     (a)  a provision of this Act or of the Registered Organisations Act;

                     (b)  an FWC order made under a provision of this Act;

                     (c)  an order of a court.

            (4)  Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), an enterprise agreement does not **_cover_** an employee, employer or employee organisation if any of the following provides, or has the effect, that the agreement does not cover the employee, employer or organisation:

                     (a)  another provision of this Act;

                     (b)  an FWC order made under another provision of this Act;

                     (c)  an order of a court.

Enterprise agreements that have ceased to operate

            (5)  Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), an enterprise agreement that has ceased to operate does not **_cover_** an employee, employer or employee organisation.

Enterprise agreements cover employees in relation to particular employment

            (6)  A reference in this Act to an enterprise agreement covering an employee is a reference to the agreement covering the employee in relation to particular employment.

##### <a id="54"></a>54  When an enterprise agreement is in operation

            (1)  An enterprise agreement approved by the FWC operates  from:

                     (a)  7 days after the agreement is approved; or

                     (b)  if a later day is specified in the agreement - that later day.

            (2)  An enterprise agreement ceases to operate on the earlier of the following days:

                     (a)  the day on which a termination of the agreement comes into operation under section 224 or 227;

                     (b)  the day on which section 58 first has the effect that there is no employee to whom the agreement applies.

Note:          Section 58 deals with when an enterprise agreement ceases to apply to an employee.

            (3)  An enterprise agreement that has ceased to operate can never operate again.

### Division 3 - Interaction between the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements

#### Subdivision A - Interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or an enterprise agreement

##### <a id="55"></a>55  Interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or enterprise agreement

National Employment Standards must not be excluded

            (1)  A modern award or enterprise agreement must not exclude the National Employment Standards or any provision of the National Employment Standards.

Terms expressly permitted by Part 2-2 or regulations may be included

            (2)  A modern award or enterprise agreement may include any terms that the award or agreement is expressly permitted to include:

                     (a)  by a provision of Part 2-2 (which deals with the National Employment Standards); or

                     (b)  by regulations made for the purposes of section 127.

Note:          In determining what is permitted to be included in a modern award or enterprise agreement by a provision referred to in paragraph (a), any regulations made for the purpose of section 127 that expressly prohibit certain terms must be taken into account.

            (3)  The National Employment Standards have effect subject to terms included in a modern award or enterprise agreement as referred to in subsection (2).

Note:          See also the note to section 63 (which deals with the effect of averaging arrangements).

Ancillary and supplementary terms may be included

            (4)  A modern award or enterprise agreement may also include the following kinds of terms:

                     (a)  terms that are ancillary or incidental to the operation of an entitlement of an employee under the National Employment Standards;

                     (b)  terms that supplement the National Employment Standards;

but only to the extent that the effect of those terms is not detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared to the National Employment Standards.

Note 1:       Ancillary or incidental terms permitted by paragraph (a) include (for example) terms:

(a)     under which, instead of taking paid annual leave at the rate of pay required by section 90, an employee may take twice as much leave at half that rate of pay; or

(b)    that specify when payment under section 90 for paid annual leave must be made.

Note 2:       Supplementary terms permitted by paragraph (b) include (for example) terms:

(a)     that increase the amount of paid annual leave to which an employee is entitled beyond the number of weeks that applies under section 87; or

(b)    that provide for an employee to be paid for taking a period of paid annual leave or paid/personal carer s leave at a rate of pay that is higher than the employee s base rate of pay (which is the rate required by sections 90 and 99).

Note 3:       Terms that would not be permitted by paragraph (a) or (b) include (for example) terms requiring an employee to give more notice of the taking of unpaid parental leave than is required by section 74.

Enterprise agreements may include terms that have the same effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards

            (5)  An enterprise agreement may include terms that have the same (or substantially the same) effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards, whether or not ancillary or supplementary terms are included as referred to in subsection (4).

Effect of terms that give an employee the same entitlement as under the National Employment Standards

            (6)  To avoid doubt, if a modern award includes terms permitted by subsection (4), or an enterprise agreement includes terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5), then, to the extent that the terms give an employee an entitlement (the **_award or agreement entitlement_**) that is the same as an entitlement (the **_NES entitlement_**) of the employee under the National Employment Standards:

                     (a)  those terms operate in parallel with the employee s NES entitlement, but not so as to give the employee a double benefit; and

                     (b)  the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to the NES entitlement apply, as a minimum standard, to the award or agreement entitlement.

Note:          For example, if the award or agreement entitlement is to 6 weeks of paid annual leave per year, the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to the accrual and taking of paid annual leave will apply, as a minimum standard, to 4 weeks of that leave.

Terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5) do not contravene subsection (1)

            (7)  To the extent that a term of a modern award or enterprise agreement is permitted by subsection (4) or (5), the term does not contravene subsection (1).

Note:          A term of a modern award has no effect to the extent that it contravenes this section (see section 56). An enterprise agreement that includes a term that contravenes this section must not be approved (see section 186) and a term of an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that it contravenes this section (see section 56).

##### <a id="56"></a>56  Terms of a modern award or enterprise agreement contravening section 55 have no effect

                   A term of a modern award or enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that it contravenes section 55.

#### Subdivision B - Interaction between modern awards and enterprise agreements

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Interaction between modern awards and enterprise agreements

            (1)  A modern award does not apply to an employee in relation to particular employment at a time when an enterprise agreement applies to the employee in relation to that employment.

            (2)  If a modern award does not apply to an employee in relation to particular employment because of subsection (1), the award does not apply to an employer, or an employee organisation, in relation to the employee.

##### <a id="57A"></a>57A  Designated outworker terms of a modern award continue to apply

            (1)  This section applies if, at a particular time:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement applies to an employer; and

                     (b)  a modern award covers the employer (whether the modern award covers the employer in the employer s capacity as an employer or an outworker entity); and

                     (c)  the modern award includes one or more designated outworker terms.

            (2)  Despite section 57, the designated outworker terms of the modern award apply at that time to the following:

                     (a)  the employer;

                     (b)  each employee who is both:

                             (i)  a person to whom the enterprise agreement applies; and

                            (ii)  a person who is covered by the modern award;

                     (c)  each employee organisation that is covered by the modern award.

            (3)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  designated outworker terms of a modern award can apply to an employer under subsection (2) even if none of the employees of the employer is an outworker; and

                     (b)  to the extent to which designated outworker terms of a modern award apply to an employer, an employee or an employee organisation because of subsection (2), the modern award applies to the employer, employee or organisation.

#### Subdivision C - Interaction between one or more enterprise agreements

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Only one enterprise agreement can apply to an employee

Only one enterprise agreement can apply to an employee

            (1)  Only one enterprise agreement can apply to an employee at a particular time.

General rule - later agreement does not apply until earlier agreement passes its nominal expiry date

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement (the **_earlier agreement_**) applies to an employee in relation to particular employment; and

                     (b)  another enterprise agreement (the **_later agreement_**) that covers the employee in relation to the same employment comes into operation; and

                     (c)  subsection (3) (which deals with a single-enterprise agreement replacing a multi-enterprise agreement) does not apply;

then:

                     (d)  if the earlier agreement has not passed its nominal expiry date:

                             (i)  the later agreement cannot apply to the employee in relation to that employment until the earlier agreement passes its nominal expiry date; and

                            (ii)  the earlier agreement ceases to apply to the employee in relation to that employment when the earlier agreement passes its nominal expiry date, and can never so apply again; or

                     (e)  if the earlier agreement has passed its nominal expiry date - the earlier agreement ceases to apply to the employee when the later agreement comes into operation, and can never so apply again.

Special rule - single-enterprise agreement replaces multi-enterprise agreement

            (3)  Despite subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  a multi-enterprise agreement applies to an employee in relation to particular employment; and

                     (b)  a single-enterprise agreement that covers the employee in relation to the same employment comes into operation;

the multi-enterprise agreement ceases to apply to the employee in relation to that employment when the single-enterprise agreement comes into operation, and can never so apply again.

## Part 2-2 - The National Employment Standards

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="59"></a>59  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part contains the National Employment Standards.

Division 2 identifies the National Employment Standards, the detail of which is set out in Divisions 3 to 12.

Division 13 contains miscellaneous provisions relating to the National Employment Standards.

The National Employment Standards are minimum standards that apply to the  employment of  national system employees. Part 2-1 (which deals with the core provisions for this Chapter) contains the obligation for employers to comply with the National Employment Standards (see section 44).

The National Employment Standards also underpin what can be included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. Part 2-1 provides that the National Employment Standards cannot be excluded by modern awards or enterprise agreements, and contains other provisions about the interaction between the National Employment Standards and modern awards or enterprise agreements (see sections 55 and 56).

Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 6-3 extend the operation of the parental leave and notice of termination provisions of the National Employment Standards to employees who are not national system employees.

* * *

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

                   In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

Note:          See also Division 2 of Part 6-4A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

### Division 2 - The National Employment Standards

##### <a id="61"></a>61  The National Employment Standards are minimum standards applying to employment of employees

            (1)  This Part sets minimum standards that apply to the employment of employees which cannot be displaced, even if an enterprise agreement includes terms of the kind referred to in subsection 55(5).

Note:          Subsection 55(5) allows enterprise agreements to include terms that have the same (or substantially the same) effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards.

            (2)  The minimum standards relate to the following matters:

                     (a)  maximum weekly hours (Division 3);

                     (b)  requests for flexible working arrangements (Division 4);

                     (c)  parental leave and related entitlements (Division 5);

                     (d)  annual leave (Division 6);

### Division 3 - Maximum weekly hours

##### <a id="62"></a>62  Maximum weekly hours

Maximum weekly hours of work

            (1)  An employer must not request or require an employee to work more than the following number of hours in a week unless the additional hours are reasonable:

                     (a)  for a full-time employee - 38 hours; or

                     (b)  for an employee who is not a full-time employee - the lesser of:

                            (ii)  the employee s ordinary hours of work in a week.

Employee may refuse to work unreasonable additional hours

            (2)  The employee may refuse to work additional hours (beyond those referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b)) if they are unreasonable.

Determining whether additional hours are reasonable

            (3)  In determining whether additional hours are reasonable or unreasonable for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the following must be taken into account:

                     (a)  any risk to employee health and safety from working the additional hours;

                     (b)  the employee s personal circumstances, including family responsibilities;

                     (c)  the needs of the workplace or enterprise in which the employee is employed;

                     (d)  whether the employee is entitled to receive overtime payments, penalty rates or other compensation for, or a level of remuneration that reflects an expectation of, working additional hours;

                     (e)  any notice given by the employer of any request or requirement to work the additional hours;

                      (f)  any notice given by the employee of his or her intention to refuse to work the additional hours;

                     (g)  the usual patterns of work in the industry, or the part of an industry, in which the employee works;

                     (h)  the nature of the employee s role, and the employee s level of responsibility;

                      (i)  whether the additional hours are in accordance with averaging terms included under section 63 in a modern award or enterprise agreement that applies to the employee, or with an averaging arrangement agreed to by the employer and employee under section 64;

                      (j)  any other relevant matter.

Authorised leave or absence treated as hours worked

            (4)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the hours an employee works in a week are taken to include any hours of leave, or absence, whether paid or unpaid, that the employee takes in the week and that are authorised:

                     (a)  by the employee s employer; or

                     (b)  by or under a term or condition of the employee s employment; or

                     (c)  by or under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or an instrument in force under such a law.

##### <a id="63"></a>63  Modern awards and enterprise agreements may provide for averaging of hours of work

            (1)  A modern award or enterprise agreement may include terms providing for the averaging of hours of work over a specified period. The average weekly hours over the period must not exceed:

                     (a)  for a full-time employee - 38 hours; or

                     (b)  for an employee who is not a full-time employee - the lesser of:

                             (i)  38 hours; and

                            (ii)  the employee s ordinary hours of work in a week.

            (2)  The terms of a modern award or enterprise agreement may provide for average weekly hours that exceed the hours referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) if the excess hours are reasonable for the purposes of subsection 62(1).

Note:          Hours in excess of the hours referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) that are worked in a week in accordance with averaging terms in a modern award or enterprise agreement (whether the terms comply with subsection (1) or (2)) will be treated as additional hours for the purposes of section 62\. The averaging terms will be relevant in determining whether the additional hours are reasonable (see paragraph 62(3)(i)).

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Averaging of hours of work for award/agreement free employees

            (1)  An employer and an award/agreement free employee may agree in writing to an averaging arrangement under which hours of work over a specified period of not more than 26 weeks are averaged. The average weekly hours over the specified period must not exceed:

                     (a)  for a full-time employee - 38 hours; or

                     (b)  for an employee who is not a full-time employee - the lesser of:

                             (i)  38 hours; and

                            (ii)  the employee s ordinary hours of work in a week.

            (2)  The agreed averaging arrangement may provide for average weekly hours that exceed the hours referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) if the excess hours are reasonable for the purposes of subsection 62(1).

Note:          Hours in excess of the hours referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) that are worked in a week in accordance with an agreed averaging arrangement (whether the arrangement complies with subsection (1) or (2)) will be treated as additional hours for the purposes of section 62\. The averaging arrangement will be relevant in determining whether the additional hours are reasonable (see paragraph 62(3)(i)).

### Division 4 - Requests for flexible working arrangements

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Requests for flexible working arrangements

Employee may request change in working arrangements

            (1)  An employee who is a parent, or has responsibility for the care, of a child may request the employer for a change in working arrangements to assist the employee to care for the child if the child:

                     (a)  is under school age; or

                     (b)  is under 18 and has a disability.

Note:          Examples of changes in working arrangements include changes in hours of work, changes in patterns of work and changes in location of work.

            (2)  The employee is not entitled to make the request unless:

                     (a)  for an employee other than a casual employee - the employee has completed at least 12 months of continuous service with the employer immediately before making the request; or

                     (b)  for a casual employee - the employee:

                             (i)  is a long term casual employee of the employer immediately before making the request; and

                            (ii)  has a reasonable expectation of continuing employment by the employer on a regular and systematic basis.

Formal requirements

            (3)  The request must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  set out details of the change sought and of the reasons for the change.

Agreeing to the request

            (4)  The employer must give the employee a written response to the request within 21 days, stating whether the employer grants or refuses the request.

            (5)  The employer may refuse the request only on reasonable business grounds.

            (6)  If the employer refuses the request, the written response under subsection (4) must include details of the reasons for the refusal.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  State and Territory laws that are not excluded

                   This Act is not intended to apply to the exclusion of laws of a State or Territory that provide employee entitlements in relation to flexible working arrangements, to the extent that those entitlements are more beneficial to employees than the entitlements under this Division.

### Division 5 - Parental leave and related entitlements

#### Subdivision A - General

(c)     for adoption - section 68 (which deals with the age etc. of the adopted child).

Note 2:       The 12 months is reduced by the amount of any unpaid special maternity leave the employee has taken (see subsection 80(7)).

##### <a id="71"></a>71  The period of leave - other than for members of an employee couple who each intend to take leave

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies to an employee who intends to take unpaid parental leave if:

When adoption-related leave must start

            (5)  If the leave is adoption-related leave, the period of leave must start on the day of placement of the child.

Leave may start later for employees whose spouse or de facto partner is not an employee

                     (b)  the spouse or de facto partner has a responsibility for the care of the child for the period between the date of birth or day of placement of the child and the start date of the leave.

Note:          An employee whose leave starts under subsection (6) is still entitled under section 76 to request an extension of the period of leave beyond his or her available parental leave period. However, the period of leave may not be extended beyond 24 months after the date of birth or day of placement of the child (see subsection 76(7)).

##### <a id="72"></a>72  The period of leave - members of an employee couple who each intend to take leave

                     (a)  one employee s period of leave must start on the day of placement of the child; and

                     (b)  the other employee s period of leave must start immediately after the end of the first employee s period of leave (or that period as extended under section 75 or 76).

Limited entitlement to take concurrent leave

            (5)  If one of the employees takes a period (the **_first employee s period of leave_**) of unpaid parental leave in accordance with paragraph (3)(a) or (4)(a), the other employee may take a period of unpaid parental leave (the **_concurrent leave_**) during the first employee s period of leave, if the concurrent leave complies with the following requirements:

                            (ii)  if the leave is adoption-related leave - the day of placement of the child;

                     (c)  if the employer agrees, the concurrent leave may (subject to paragraph (a)):

                             (i)  start earlier than is permitted by paragraph (b); or

                            (ii)  end up to 3 weeks later than is permitted by paragraph (b).

            (6)  Concurrent leave taken by an employee:

                     (a)  is an exception to the rule that the employee must take his or her leave in a single continuous period (see subsection (2)); and

                     (b)  is an exception to the rules about when the employee s period of unpaid parental leave must start (see subsection (3) or (4)).

Note:          The concurrent leave is unpaid parental leave and so comes out of the employee s entitlement to 12 months of unpaid parental leave under section 70.

##### <a id="73"></a>73  Pregnant employee may be required to take unpaid parental leave within 6 weeks before the birth

Employer may ask employee to provide a medical certificate

                     (a)  a statement of whether the employee is fit for work;

                     (b)  if the employee is fit for work - a statement of whether it is inadvisable for the employee to continue in her present position during a stated period because of:

                            (ii)  hazards connected with the position.

                     (b)  within 7 days after the request, the employee gives the employer a medical certificate stating that the employee is not fit for work; or

                     (c)  the following subparagraphs are satisfied:

                             (i)  within 7 days after the request, the employee gives the employer a medical certificate stating that the employee is fit for work, but that it is inadvisable for the employee to continue in her present position for a stated period for a reason referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) or (ii);

                            (ii)  section 81 does not apply to the employee.

Note:          If the medical certificate contains a statement as referred to in subparagraph (c)(i) and section 81 applies to the employee, the employee is entitled under that section to be transferred to a safe job, or to paid no safe job leave.

When the period of leave must end

            (3)  The period of leave must not end later than the earlier of the following:

                     (a)  the end of the pregnancy;

                     (b)  if the employee has given the employer notice of the taking of a period of leave connected with the birth of the child (whether it is unpaid parental leave or some other kind of leave) - the start date of that leave.

Special rules about the period of leave

            (4)  The period of leave:

                     (a)  is an exception to the rule that the employee must take her unpaid parental leave in a single continuous period (see subsection 71(2) or 72(2)); and

                     (b)  is an exception to the rules about when the employee s period of unpaid parental leave must start (see subsections 71(3) and (6), or subsection 72(3)).

Note:          The period of leave is unpaid parental leave and so comes out of the employee s entitlement to 12 months of unpaid parental leave under section 70.

            (5)  The employee is not required to comply with section 74 in relation to the period of leave.

##### <a id="74"></a>74  Notice and evidence requirements

##### <a id="77A"></a>77A  Pregnancy ends (other than by birth of a living child) or child born alive dies

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies to unpaid parental leave, if:

                     (a)  the leave is birth-related leave; and

                     (b)  either:

                             (i)  the pregnancy ends other than by the child being born alive; or

                            (ii)  the child dies after being born.

Cancellation of leave

            (2)  Before the leave starts:

                     (a)  the employee may give the employer written notice cancelling the leave; or

                     (b)  the employer may give the employee written notice cancelling the leave.

Example:    Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if:

(a)     the child dies after being born; and

(b)    the employee is the female employee who gave birth to the child.

                     This is because in this case the leave must not start later than the date of birth of the child (see subsection 71(3)).

            (3)  If the employee or employer does so, the employee is not entitled to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child.

Note:          If the employee is the female employee who was pregnant with the child and the employee is not fit for work, she may be entitled to:

(a)     paid personal leave under Subdivision A of Division 7; or

(b)    unpaid special maternity leave under section 80.

Return to work

            (4)  The employee may give the employer written notice that the employee wishes to return to work:

                     (a)  after the start of the period of leave, but before its end; and

                     (b)  within 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice.

            (5)  The employer:

                     (a)  may give the employee written notice requiring the employee to return to work on a specified day; and

                     (b)  must do so if the employee gives the employer written notice under subsection (4);

unless the leave has not started and the employer cancels it under subsection (2).

            (6)  The specified day must be after the start of the period of leave, and:

                     (a)  if subsection (4) applies - within 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice under that subsection; or

                     (b)  otherwise - at least 6 weeks after the notice is given to the employee under subsection (5).

            (7)  The employee s entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends immediately before the specified day.

Interaction with section 77

            (8)  This section does not limit section 77 (which deals with the employee ending the period of unpaid parental leave with the agreement of the employer).

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Employee who ceases to have responsibility for care of child

            (1)  This section applies to an employee who has taken unpaid parental leave in relation to a child if the employee ceases to have any responsibility for the care of the child.

          (1A)  However, this section does not apply if section 77A applies to the unpaid parental leave (because the unpaid parental leave is birth-related leave and either the pregnancy ends other than by the child being born alive or the child dies after being born).

            (2)  The employer may give the employee written notice requiring the employee to return to work on a specified day.

            (3)  The specified day:

                     (a)  must be at least 4 weeks after the notice is given to the employee; and

                     (b)  if the leave is birth-related leave taken by a female employee who has given birth - must not be earlier than 6 weeks after the date of birth of the child.

            (4)  The employee s entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends immediately before the specified day.

##### <a id="79"></a>79  Interaction with paid leave

            (1)  This Subdivision (except for subsections (2) and (3)) does not prevent an employee from taking any other kind of paid leave while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave. If the employee does so, the taking of that other paid leave does not break the continuity of the period of unpaid parental leave.

Note:          For example, if the employee has paid annual leave available, he or she may (with the employer s agreement) take some or all of that paid annual leave at the same time as the unpaid parental leave.

            (2)  An employee is not entitled to take paid personal/carer s leave or compassionate leave while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave.

            (3)  An employee is not entitled to any payment under Division 8 (which deals with community service leave) in relation to activities the employee engages in while taking unpaid parental leave.

##### <a id="79A"></a>79A  Keeping in touch days

            (1)  This Subdivision does not prevent an employee from performing work for his or her employer on a keeping in touch day while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave. If the employee does so, the performance of that work does not break the continuity of the period of unpaid parental leave.

### Division 9 - Long service leave

##### <a id="113"></a>113  Entitlement to long service leave

Entitlement in accordance with applicable award-derived long service leave terms

            (1)  If there are applicable award-derived long service leave terms (see subsection (3)) in relation to an employee, the employee is entitled to long service leave in accordance with those terms.

Note:          This Act does not exclude State and Territory laws that deal with long service leave, except in relation to employees who are entitled to long service leave under this Division (see paragraph 27(2)(g)), and except as provided in subsection 113A(3).

            (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  a workplace agreement, or an AWA, that came into operation before the commencement of this Part applies to the employee; or

                     (b)  one of the following kinds of instrument that came into operation before the commencement of this Part applies to the employee and expressly deals with long service leave:

                             (i)  an enterprise agreement;

                            (ii)  a preserved State agreement;

                           (iii)  a workplace determination;

                           (iv)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                            (v)  a pre-reform AWA;

                           (vi)  a section 170MX award;

                          (vii)  an old IR agreement.

Note:          If there ceases to be any agreement or instrument of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) that applies to the employee, the employee will, at that time, become entitled under subsection (1) to long service leave in accordance with applicable award-derived long service leave terms.

            (3)  **_Applicable award-derived long service leave terms_**, in relation to an employee, are:

                     (a)  terms of an award, or a State reference transitional award, that (disregarding the effect of any instrument of a kind referred to in subsection (2)):

                             (i)  would have applied to the employee at the test time (see subsection (3A)) if the employee had, at that time, been in his or her current circumstances of employment; and

                            (ii)  would have entitled the employee to long service leave; and

                     (b)  any terms of the award, or the State reference transitional award, that are ancillary or incidental to the terms referred to in paragraph (a).

          (3A)  For the purpose of subparagraph (3)(a)(i), the test time is:

                     (a)  immediately before the commencement of this Part; or

                     (b)  if the employee is a Division 2B State reference employee (as defined in Schedule 2 to the Transitional Act) - immediately before the Division 2B referral commencement (as defined in that Schedule).

Entitlement in accordance with applicable agreement-derived long service leave terms

            (4)  If there are applicable agreement-derived long service leave terms (see subsection (5)) in relation to an employee, the employee is entitled to long service leave in accordance with those terms.

            (5)  There are **_applicable agreement-derived long service leave terms_**, in relation to an employee if:

                     (a)  an order under subsection (6) is in operation in relation to terms of an instrument; and

                     (b)  those terms of the instrument would have applied to the employee immediately before the commencement of this Part if the employee had, at that time, been in his or her current circumstances of employment; and

                     (c)  there are no applicable award-derived long service leave terms in relation to the employee.

            (6)  If the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (a)  any of the following instruments that was in operation  immediately before the commencement of this Part contained terms entitling employees to long service leave:

                             (i)  an enterprise agreement;

                            (ii)  a collective agreement;

                           (iii)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                           (iv)  an old IR agreement; and

                     (b)  those terms constituted a long service leave scheme that was applying in more than one State or Territory; and

                     (c)  the scheme, considered on an overall basis, is no less beneficial to the employees than the long service leave entitlements that would otherwise apply in relation to the employees under State and Territory laws;

the FWC may, on application by, or on behalf of, a person to whom the instrument applies, make an order that those terms of the instrument (and any terms that are ancillary or incidental to those terms) are applicable agreement-derived long service leave terms.

References to instruments

            (7)  References in this section to a kind of instrument (other than an enterprise agreement) are references to a transitional instrument of that kind, as continued in existence by Schedule 3 to the Transitional Act.

##### <a id="113A"></a>113A  Enterprise agreements may contain terms discounting service under prior agreements etc. in certain circumstances

            (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an instrument (the **_first instrument_**) of one of the following kinds that came into operation before the commencement of this Part applies to an employee on or after the commencement of this Part:

                             (i)  an enterprise agreement;

                            (ii)  a workplace agreement;

                           (iii)  a workplace determination;

                           (iv)  a preserved State agreement;

                            (v)  an AWA;

                           (vi)  a pre-reform certified agreement;

                          (vii)  a pre-reform AWA;

                         (viii)  an old IR agreement;

                           (ix)  a section 170MX award; and

                     (b)  the instrument states that the employee is not entitled to long service leave; and

                     (c)  the instrument ceases, for whatever reason, to apply to the employee; and

                     (d)  immediately after the first instrument ceases to apply, an enterprise agreement (the **_replacement agreement_**) starts to apply to the employee.

            (2)  The replacement agreement  may include terms to the effect that an employee s service with the employer during a specified period (the **_excluded period_**) (being some or all of the period when the first instrument applied to the employee) does not count as service for the purpose of determining whether the employee is qualified for long service leave, or the amount of long service leave to which the employee is entitled, under this Division or under a law of a State or Territory.

            (3)  If the replacement agreement includes terms as permitted by subsection (2), the excluded period does not count, and never again counts, as service for the purpose of determining whether the employee is qualified for long service leave, or the amount of long service leave to which the employee is entitled, under this Division or under a law of a State or Territory, unless a later agreement provides otherwise. This subsection has effect despite sections 27 and 29.

            (4)  References in this section to a kind of instrument (other than an enterprise agreement) are references to a transitional instrument of that kind, as continued in existence by Schedule 3 to the Transitional Act.

##### <a id="120"></a>120  Variation of redundancy pay for other employment or incapacity to pay

            (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an employee is entitled to be paid an amount of redundancy pay by the employer because of section 119; and

                     (b)  the employer:

                             (i)  obtains other acceptable employment for the employee; or

                            (ii)  cannot pay the amount.

            (2)  On application by the employer, the FWC may determine that the amount of redundancy pay is reduced to a specified amount (which may be nil) that the FWC considers appropriate.

            (3)  The amount of redundancy pay to which the employee is entitled under section 119 is the reduced amount specified in the determination.

##### <a id="121"></a>121  Exclusions from obligation to pay redundancy pay

            (1)  Section 119 does not apply to the termination of an employee s employment if, immediately before the time of the termination, or at the time when the person was given notice of the termination as described in subsection 117(1) (whichever happened first):

                     (a)  the employee s period of continuous service with the employer is less than 12 months; or

                     (b)  the employer is a small business employer.

            (2)  A modern award may include a term specifying other situations in which section 119 does not apply to the termination of an employee s employment.

            (3)  If a modern award that is in operation includes such a term (the **_award term_**), an enterprise agreement may:

                     (a)  incorporate the award term by reference (and as in force from time to time) into the enterprise agreement; and

                     (b)  provide that the incorporated term covers some or all of the employees who are also covered by the award term.

##### <a id="122"></a>122  Transfer of employment situations that affect the obligation to pay redundancy pay

Transfer of employment situation in which employer may decide not to recognise employee s service with first employer

            (1)  Subsection 22(5) does not apply (for the purpose of this Subdivision) to a transfer of employment between non-associated entities in relation to an employee if the second employer decides not to recognise the employee s service with the first employer (for the purpose of this Subdivision).

Employee is not entitled to redundancy pay if service with first employer counts as service with second employer

            (2)  If subsection 22(5) applies (for the purpose of this Subdivision) to a transfer of employment in relation to an employee, the employee is not entitled to redundancy pay under section 119 in relation to the termination of his or her employment with the first employer.

Note:          Subsection 22(5) provides that, generally, if there is a transfer of employment, service with the first employer counts as service with the second employer.

Employee not entitled to redundancy pay if refuses employment in certain circumstances

            (3)  An employee is not entitled to redundancy pay under section 119 in relation to the termination of his or her employment with an employer (the **_first employer_**) if:

                     (a)  the employee rejects an offer of employment made by another employer (the **_second employer_**) that:

                             (i)  is on terms and conditions substantially similar to, and, considered on an overall basis, no less favourable than, the employee s terms and conditions of employment with the first employer immediately before the termination; and

                            (ii)  recognises the employee s service with the first employer, for the purpose of this Subdivision; and

                     (b)  had the employee accepted the offer, there would have been a transfer of employment in relation to the employee.

            (4)  If the FWC is satisfied that subsection (3) operates unfairly to the employee, the FWC may order the first employer to pay the employee a specified amount of redundancy pay (not exceeding the amount that would be payable but for subsection (3)) that the FWC considers appropriate. The first employer must pay the employee that amount of redundancy pay.

#### Subdivision C - Limits on scope of this Division

            (3)  The Fair Work Information Statement is not a legislative instrument.

            (4)  The regulations may prescribe other matters relating to the content or form of the Statement, or the manner in which employers may give the Statement to employees.

##### <a id="125"></a>125  Giving new employees the Fair Work Information Statement

            (1)  An employer must give each employee the Fair Work Information Statement before, or as soon as practicable after, the employee starts employment.

            (2)  Subsection (1) does not require the employer to give the employee the Statement more than once in any 12 months.

Note:          This is relevant if the employer employs the employee more than once in the 12 months.

### Division 13 - Miscellaneous

##### <a id="126"></a>126  Modern awards and enterprise agreements may provide for school-based apprentices and trainees to be paid loadings in lieu

                   A modern award or enterprise agreement may provide for school-based apprentices or school-based trainees to be paid loadings in lieu of any of the following:

                     (b)  paid personal/carer s leave;

                     (c)  paid absence under Division 10 (which deals with public holidays).

Note:       Section 199 affects whether the FWC may approve an enterprise agreement covering an employee who is a school-based apprentice or school-based trainee, if the employee is covered by a modern award that is in operation and provides for the employee to be paid loadings in lieu of paid annual leave, paid personal/carer s leave or paid absence under Division 10.

##### <a id="127"></a>127  Regulations about what modern awards and enterprise agreements can do

                   The regulations may:

                     (a)  permit modern awards or enterprise agreements or both to include terms that would or might otherwise be contrary to this Part or section 55 (which deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or enterprise agreement); or

                     (b)  prohibit modern awards or enterprise agreements or both from including terms that would or might otherwise be permitted by a provision of this Part or section 55.

##### <a id="128"></a>128  Relationship between National Employment Standards and agreements etc. permitted by this Part for award/agreement free employees

                   The National Employment Standards have effect subject to:

                     (a)  an agreement between an employer and an award/agreement free employee or a requirement made by an employer of an award/agreement free employee, that is expressly permitted by a provision of this Part; or

                     (b)  an agreement between an employer and an award/agreement free employee that is expressly permitted by regulations made for the purpose of section 129.

Note 1:       In determining what matters are permitted to be agreed or required under paragraph (a), any regulations made for the purpose of section 129 that expressly prohibit certain agreements or requirements must be taken into account.

## Part 2-3 - Modern awards

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="132"></a>132  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part provides for the FWC to make, vary and revoke modern awards. Modern awards may set minimum terms and conditions for national system employees in particular industries or occupations. Modern awards can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards (see Part 2-1).

Division 2 provides for the modern awards objective. This requires the FWC to ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account certain social and economic factors. Division 2 also contains special provisions about modern award minimum wages.

Division 3 deals with the terms of modern awards.

Division 4 provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of modern awards.

Division 5 provides for the FWC to exercise modern award powers outside the system of 4 yearly reviews in certain circumstances.

Division 6 contains some general provisions relating to modern award powers.

Division 7 contains additional provisions relating to modern enterprise awards.

Division 8 contains additional provisions relating to State reference public sector modern awards.

The obligation to comply with a modern award is in section 45 (in Part 2-1).

In relation to minimum wages in modern awards, the FWC has powers both under this Part and under Part 2-6 (which deals with minimum wages). The following is a summary of the FWC s powers under the 2 Parts:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   the initial making of a
modern award setting modern award minimum wages can only occur under this Part;</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   the main power to vary
modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 2-6;</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   modern award minimum wages
can also be varied under this Part, but only for work value reasons or in other
limited circumstances;</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(d)   modern award minimum wages
can be set (otherwise than in the initial making of a modern award) or revoked
either under this Part or in annual wage reviews under Part 2-6.</li>

* * *

##### <a id="133"></a>133  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

                   In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

Note:          See also Division 2 of Part 6-4A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

### Division 2 - Overarching provisions

##### <a id="134"></a>134  The modern awards objective

What is the modern awards objective?

            (1)  The FWC must ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account:

                     (a)  relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and

                     (b)  the need to encourage collective bargaining; and

                     (c)  the need to promote social inclusion through increased workforce participation; and

                     (d)  the need to promote flexible modern work practices and the efficient and productive performance of work; and

                     (e)  the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value; and

                      (f)  the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on business, including on productivity, employment costs and the regulatory burden; and

                     (g)  the need to ensure a simple, easy to understand, stable and sustainable modern award system for Australia that avoids unnecessary overlap of modern awards; and

                     (h)  the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on employment growth, inflation and the sustainability, performance and competitiveness of the national economy.

This is the **_modern awards objective_**.

When does the modern awards objective apply?

            (2)  The modern awards objective applies to the performance or exercise of the FWC s **_modern award powers_**, which are:

                     (a)  the FWC s functions or powers under this Part; and

                     (b)  the FWC s functions or powers under Part 2-6, so far as they relate to modern award minimum wages.

Note:          The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the minimum wages objective also applies (see section 284).

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Special provisions relating to modern award minimum wages

            (1)  Modern award minimum wages cannot be varied under this Part except as follows:

                     (a)  modern award minimum wages can be varied if the FWC is satisfied that the variation is justified by work value reasons (see subsections 156(3) and 157(2));

                     (b)  modern award minimum wages can be varied under section 160 (which deals with variation to remove ambiguities or correct errors) or section 161 (which deals with variation on referral by the Australian Human Rights Commission).

Note 1:       The main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 2-6\. Modern award minimum wages can also be set or revoked in annual wage reviews.

Note 2:       For the meanings of **_modern award minimum wages_**, and **_setting_** and **_varying_** such wages, see section 284.

            (2)  In exercising its powers under this Part to set, vary or revoke modern award minimum wages, the FWC must take into account the rate of the national minimum wage as currently set in a national minimum wage order.

### Division 3 - Terms of modern awards

                     (b)  Subdivision C (which deals with terms that must be included in modern awards); or

                     (c)  section 55 (which deals with interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or enterprise agreement); or

                     (a)  Subdivision D (which deals with terms that must not be included in modern awards); or

                     (b)  section 55 (which deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or enterprise agreement).

Note:          The provisions referred to in subsection (2) limit the terms that can be included in modern awards under the provisions referred to in subsection (1).

##### <a id="137"></a>137  Terms that contravene section 136 have no effect

                   A term of a modern award has no effect to the extent that it contravenes section 136.

##### <a id="138"></a>138  Achieving the modern awards objective

                   A modern award may include terms that it is permitted to include, and must include terms that it is required to include, only to the extent necessary to achieve the modern awards objective and (to the extent applicable) the minimum wages objective.

#### Subdivision B - Terms that may be included in modern awards

##### <a id="139"></a>139  Terms that may be included in modern awards - general

                           (iii)  shift workers;

                      (f)  annualised wage arrangements that:

                             (i)  have regard to the patterns of work in an occupation, industry or enterprise; and

                            (ii)  provide an alternative to the separate payment of wages and other monetary entitlements; and

                           (iii)  include appropriate safeguards to ensure that individual employees are not disadvantaged;

                     (g)  allowances, including for any of the following:

                             (i)  expenses incurred in the course of employment;

                            (ii)  responsibilities or skills that are not taken into account in rates of pay;

                      (i)  superannuation;

                      (j)  procedures for consultation, representation and dispute settlement.

            (2)  Any allowance included in a modern award must be separately and clearly identified in the award.

##### <a id="140"></a>140  Outworker terms

            (1)  A modern award may include either or both of the following:

                     (a)  terms relating to the conditions under which an employer may employ employees who are outworkers;

                     (b)  terms relating to the conditions under which an outworker entity may arrange for work to be performed for the entity (either directly or indirectly), if the work is of a kind that is often performed by outworkers.

Note:          A person who is an employer may also be an outworker entity (see the definition of **_outworker entity_** in section 12).

            (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), terms referred to in that subsection may include terms relating to the pay or conditions of outworkers.

            (3)  The following terms of a modern award are **_outworker terms_**:

                     (a)  terms referred to in subsection (1);

                     (b)  terms that are incidental to terms referred to in subsection (1), included in the modern award under subsection 142(1);

                     (c)  machinery terms in relation to terms referred to in subsection (1), included in the modern award under subsection 142(2).

##### <a id="141"></a>141  Industry-specific redundancy schemes

When can a modern award include an industry-specific redundancy scheme?

            (1)  A modern award may include an industry-specific redundancy scheme if the scheme was included in the award:

                     (a)  in the  award modernisation process; or

                     (b)  in accordance with subsection (2).

Note:          An employee to whom an industry-specific redundancy scheme in a modern award applies is not entitled to the redundancy entitlements in Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part 2-2.

Coverage of industry-specific redundancy schemes must not be extended

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  a modern award includes an industry-specific redundancy scheme; and

                     (b)  the FWC is making or varying another modern award under Division 4 or 5 so that it (rather than the modern award referred to in paragraph (a)) will cover some or all of the classes of employees who are covered by the scheme;

the FWC may include the scheme in that other modern award. However, the FWC must not extend the coverage of the scheme to classes of employees that it did not previously cover.

Varying industry-specific redundancy schemes

            (3)  The FWC may only vary an industry-specific redundancy scheme in a modern award under  Division 4 or 5:

                     (a)  by varying the amount of any redundancy payment in the scheme; or

                     (b)  in accordance with a provision of Subdivision B of Division 5 (which deals with varying modern awards in some limited situations).

            (4)  In varying an industry-specific redundancy scheme as referred to in subsection (3), the FWC:

                     (a)  must not extend the coverage of the scheme to classes of employees that it did not previously cover; and

            (1)  A modern award must include a term (a **_flexibility term_**) enabling an employee and his or her employer to agree on an arrangement (an **_individual_** **_flexibility arrangement_**) varying the effect of the award in relation to the employee and the employer, in order to meet the genuine needs of the employee and employer.

Effect of individual flexibility arrangements

            (2)  If an employee and employer agree to an individual flexibility arrangement under a flexibility term in a modern award:

                     (b)  the arrangement is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be a term of the modern award.

            (3)  To avoid doubt, the individual flexibility arrangement does not change the effect the modern award has in relation to the employer and any other employee.

Requirements for flexibility terms

            (4)  The flexibility term must:

                     (a)  identify the terms of the modern award the effect of which may be varied by an individual flexibility arrangement; and

                     (b)  require that the employee and the employer genuinely agree to any individual flexibility arrangement; and

                     (c)  require the employer to ensure that any individual flexibility arrangement must result in the employee being better off overall than the employee would have been if no individual flexibility arrangement were agreed to; and

                     (d)  set out how any flexibility arrangement may be terminated by the employee or the employer; and

                     (e)  require the employer to ensure that any individual flexibility arrangement must be in writing and signed:

                             (i)  in all cases - by the employee and the employer; and

                            (ii)  if the employee is under 18 - by a parent or guardian of the employee; and

                      (f)  require the employer to ensure that a copy of any individual flexibility arrangement must be given to the employee.

            (5)  Except as required by subparagraph (4)(e)(ii), the flexibility term must not require that any individual flexibility arrangement agreed to by an employer and employee under the term must be approved, or consented to, by another person.

##### <a id="145"></a>145  Effect of individual flexibility arrangement that does not meet requirements of flexibility term

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an employee and employer agree to an arrangement that purports to be an individual flexibility arrangement under a flexibility term in a modern award; and

                     (b)  the arrangement does not meet a requirement set out in section 144.

Note:          A failure to meet such a requirement may be a contravention of a provision of Part 3-1 (which deals with general protections).

Arrangement has effect as if it were an individual flexibility arrangement

            (2)  The arrangement has effect as if it were an individual flexibility arrangement.

Employer contravenes flexibility term in specified circumstances

            (3)  If subsection 144(4) requires the employer to ensure that the arrangement meets the requirement, the employer contravenes the flexibility term of the award.

Flexibility arrangement may be terminated by agreement or notice

            (4)  The flexibility term is taken to provide (in addition to any other means of termination of the arrangement that the term provides) that the arrangement can be terminated:

                     (a)  by either the employee, or the employer, giving written notice of not more than 28 days; or

                     (b)  by the employee and the employer at any time if they agree, in writing, to the termination.

##### <a id="146"></a>146  Terms about settling disputes

                   Without limiting paragraph 139(1)(j), a modern award must include a term that provides a procedure for settling disputes:

                     (a)  about any matters arising under the award; and

                     (b)  in relation to the National Employment Standards.

Note:          The FWC or a person must not settle a dispute about whether an employer had reasonable business grounds under subsection 65(5) or 76(4) (see subsections 739(2) and 740(2)).

##### <a id="147"></a>147  Ordinary hours of work

                   A modern award must include terms specifying, or providing for the determination of, the ordinary hours of work for each classification of employee covered by the award and each type of employment permitted by the award.

Note:          An employee s ordinary hours of work are significant in determining the employee s entitlements under the National Employment Standards.

##### <a id="148"></a>148  Base and full rates of pay for pieceworkers

                   If a modern award defines or describes employees covered by the award as pieceworkers, the award must include terms specifying, or providing for the determination of, base and full rates of pay for those employees for the purposes of the National Employment Standards.

Note:          An employee s base and full rates of pay are significant in determining the employee s entitlements under the National Employment Standards.

##### <a id="149"></a>149  Automatic variation of allowances

                   If a modern award includes allowances that the FWC considers are of a kind that should be varied when wage rates in  the award are varied, the award must include terms providing for the automatic variation of those allowances when wage rates in the award are varied.

##### <a id="149A"></a>149A  Superannuation contributions for defined benefit members

            (1)  A modern award must include a term that permits an employer covered by the award to make contributions to a superannuation fund or scheme in relation to a default fund employee who is:

                     (a)  covered by the award; and

                     (b)  a defined benefit member of the fund or scheme.

Note:          An employer may make contributions under this term even if the superannuation fund or scheme to which the contributions are made is not specified in the modern award because of section 155A.

            (2)  An employee is a **_default fund employee_** if the employee has no chosen fund within the meaning of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_.

#### Subdivision D - Terms that must not be included in modern awards

##### <a id="150"></a>150  Objectionable terms

##### <a id="151"></a>151  Terms about payments and deductions for benefit of employer etc.

                   A modern award must not include a term that has no effect because of subsection 326(1) (which deals with unreasonable payments and deductions for the benefit of an employer) or subsection 326(3) (which deals with unreasonable requirements to spend an amount).

Certain terms are not discriminatory

            (2)  A term of a modern award does not discriminate against an employee:

                     (a)  if the reason for the discrimination is the inherent requirements of the particular position held by the employee; or

                     (b)  merely because it discriminates, in relation to employment of the employee as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed:

                             (i)  in good faith; and

                            (ii)  to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed.

            (3)  A term of a modern award does not discriminate against an employee merely because it provides for minimum wages for:

                     (a)  all junior employees, or a class of junior employees; or

                     (b)  all employees with a disability, or a class of employees with a disability; or

                     (c)  all employees to whom training arrangements apply, or a class of employees to whom training arrangements apply.

                     (a)  are determined by reference to State or Territory boundaries; or

                     (b)  are expressed to operate in one or more, but not every, State and Territory.

When State-based difference terms may be included

            (2)  However, a modern award may include State-based difference terms if the terms were included in the award:

                     (a)  in the award modernisation process; or

                     (b)  in accordance with subsection (3);

but only for up to 5 years starting on the day on which the first modern award that included those terms came into operation.

            (3)  If:

                     (a)  a modern award includes State-based difference terms as permitted under subsection (2); and

                     (b)  the FWC is making or varying another modern award so that it (rather than the modern award referred to in paragraph (a)) will cover some or all of the classes of employees who are covered by those terms;

the FWC may include those terms in that other modern award. However, the FWC must not extend the coverage of those terms to classes of employees that they did not previously cover.

##### <a id="155"></a>155  Terms dealing with long service leave

                   A modern award must not include terms dealing with long service leave.

##### <a id="155A"></a>155A  Terms dealing with superannuation

            (1)  A modern award must not include a term that has the effect of requiring or permitting contributions, for the benefit of an employee covered by the award who is a default fund employee, to be made to a superannuation fund or scheme specified in the modern award, unless one of the following is satisfied in relation to the fund or scheme:

                     (a)  it is a fund that offers a MySuper product;

                     (b)  it is an exempt public sector superannuation scheme.

Note:          Contributions may be made to a superannuation fund or scheme for its defined benefit members under section 149A even though the fund or scheme is not specified in a modern award because of this section.

            (2)  Subsection (3) applies if the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (**_APRA_**) gives FWA notice under subsection 29U(4) of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ that a regulated superannuation fund no longer offers any MySuper product.

            (3)  FWA must:

                     (a)  ensure that the text of a modern award as published by FWA does not include a term that has the effect of requiring or permitting contributions, for the benefit of an employee covered by the award who is a default fund employee, to be made to the fund; and

                     (b)  do so as soon as is reasonably practicable after receiving the notice.

            (4)  Subsection (5) applies if APRA gives FWA notice under section 29XC of the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ that a scheme has ceased to be an exempt public sector superannuation scheme and does not offer a MySuper product.

            (5)  FWA must:

                     (a)  ensure that the text of a modern award as published by FWA does not include a term that has the effect of requiring or permitting contributions, for the benefit of an employee covered by the award who is a default fund employee, to be made to the scheme; and

            (1)  The FWC must conduct a **_4 yearly review of modern awards_** starting as soon as practicable after each 4th anniversary of the commencement of this Part.

Note 1:       The FWC must be constituted by a Full Bench to conduct 4 yearly reviews of modern awards, and to make determinations and modern awards in those reviews (see subsections 616(1), (2) and (3)).

Note 2:       The President may give directions about the conduct of 4 yearly reviews of modern awards (see section 582).

What has to be done in a 4 yearly review?

            (2)  In a 4 yearly review of modern awards, the FWC:

                     (a)  must review all modern awards; and

                     (b)  may make:

Note:          Special criteria apply to changing coverage of modern awards or revoking modern awards (see sections 163 and 164).

Variation of modern award minimum wages must be justified by work value reasons

            (3)  In a 4 yearly review of modern awards, the FWC may make a determination varying modern award minimum wages only if the FWC is satisfied that the variation of modern award minimum wages is justified by work value reasons.

            (4)  **_Work value reasons_** are reasons justifying the amount that employees should be paid for doing a particular kind of work, being reasons related to any of the following:

                     (a)  the nature of the work;

                     (b)  the level of skill or responsibility involved in doing the work;

                     (c)  the conditions under which the work is done.

Each modern award to be reviewed in its own right

            (5)  A 4 yearly review of modern awards must be such that each modern award is reviewed in its own right. However, this does not prevent the FWC from reviewing 2 or more modern awards at the same time.

### Division 5 - Exercising modern award powers outside 4 yearly reviews and annual wage reviews

#### Subdivision A - Exercise of powers if necessary to achieve modern awards objective

##### <a id="157"></a>157  FWC may vary etc. modern awards if necessary to achieve modern awards objective

            (1)  The FWC may:

                     (a)  make a determination varying a modern award, otherwise than to vary modern award minimum wages; or

                     (b)  make a modern award; or

                     (c)  make a determination revoking a modern award;

if the FWC is satisfied that making the determination or modern award outside the system of 4 yearly reviews of modern awards is necessary to achieve the modern awards objective.

Note 1:       The FWC must be constituted by a Full Bench to make a modern award (see subsection 616(1)).

Note 2:       Special criteria apply to changing coverage of modern awards or revoking modern awards (see sections 163 and 164).

Note 3:       If the FWC is setting modern award minimum wages, the minimum wages objective also applies (see section 284).

            (2)  The FWC may make a determination varying modern award minimum wages if the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the variation of modern award minimum wages is justified by work value reasons; and

                     (b)  making the determination outside the system of annual wage reviews and the system of 4 yearly reviews of modern awards is necessary to achieve the modern awards objective.

Note:          As the FWC is varying modern award minimum wages, the minimum wages objective also applies (see section 284).

            (3)  The FWC may make a determination or modern award under this section:

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application under section 158.

                     (a)  to reflect a change in the name of an employer, organisation or outworker entity; or

                     (b)  to omit the name of an organisation, employer or outworker entity from the modern award, if:

                             (i)  the registration of the organisation has been cancelled under the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_; or

                            (ii)  the employer, organisation or outworker entity has ceased to exist; or

                     (c)  if the modern award is a named employer award and the named employer is the old employer in a transfer of business - to reflect the transfer of business to the new employer.

            (2)  The FWC may make a determination under this section:

                     (a)  in any case - on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  if paragraph (1)(a) or (b) applies - on application by the employer, organisation or outworker entity referred to in that paragraph; or

                     (c)  if paragraph (1)(c) applies - on application by:

                             (i)  the old employer or the new employer; or

                            (ii)  a transferring employee who was covered by the modern award as an employee of the old employer; or

                           (iii)  an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the old employer, the new employer, or one or more employees referred to in subparagraph (ii).

##### <a id="160"></a>160  Variation of modern award to remove ambiguity or uncertainty or correct error

            (1)  The FWC may make a determination varying a modern award to remove an ambiguity or uncertainty or to correct an error.

                     (a)  on its own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application by an employer, employee, organisation or outworker entity that is covered by the modern award; or

                     (c)  on application by an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more employers or employees that are covered by the modern award; or

                     (d)  if the modern award includes outworker terms - on application by an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more outworkers to whom the outworker terms relate.

##### <a id="161"></a>161  Variation of modern award on referral by Australian Human Rights Commission

            (1)  The FWC must review a modern award if the award is referred to it under section 46PW of the _Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986_ (which deals with discriminatory industrial instruments).

            (2)  The following are entitled to make submissions to the FWC for consideration in the review:

                     (a)  if the referral relates to action that would be unlawful under Part 4 of the _Age Discrimination Act 2004_ - the Age Discrimination Commissioner;

                     (b)  if the referral relates to action that would be unlawful under Part 2 of the _Disability Discrimination Act 1992_ - the Disability Discrimination Commissioner;

                     (c)  if the referral relates to action that would be unlawful under Part II of the _Sex Discrimination Act 1984_ - the Sex Discrimination Commissioner.

            (3)  If the FWC considers that the modern award reviewed requires a person to do an act that would be unlawful under any of the Acts referred to in subsection (2) (but for the fact that the act would be done in direct compliance with the modern award), the FWC must make a determination varying the modern award so that it no longer requires the person to do an act that would be so unlawful.

Note:          Special criteria apply to changing coverage of modern awards (see section 163).

### Division 6 - General provisions relating to modern award powers

(d)    section 601 (which deals with writing and publication requirements).

##### <a id="163"></a>163  Special criteria relating to changing coverage of modern awards

Special rule about reducing coverage

            (1)  The FWC must not make a determination varying a modern award so that certain employers or employees stop being covered by the award unless the FWC is satisfied that they will instead become covered by another modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that is appropriate for them.

Special rule about making a modern award

            (2)  The FWC must not make a modern award covering certain employers or employees unless the FWC has considered whether it should, instead, make a determination varying an existing modern award to cover them.

Special rule about covering organisations

            (3)  The FWC must not make a modern award, or make a determination varying a modern award, so that an organisation becomes covered by the award, unless the organisation is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more employers or employees who are or will be covered by the award.

The miscellaneous modern award

            (4)  The **_miscellaneous modern award_** is the modern award that is expressed to cover employees who are not covered by any other modern award.

##### <a id="164"></a>164  Special criteria for revoking modern awards

                   The FWC must not make a determination revoking a modern award unless the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the award is obsolete or no longer capable of operating; or

                     (b)  all the employees covered by the award are covered by a different modern award (other than the miscellaneous modern award) that is appropriate for them, or will be so covered when the revocation comes into operation.

##### <a id="165"></a>165  When variation determinations come into operation, other than determinations setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages

Determinations come into operation on specified day

            (1)  A determination under this Part that varies a modern award (other than a determination that sets, varies or revokes modern award minimum wages) comes into operation on the day specified in the determination.

Note 1:       For when a modern award, or a revocation of a modern award, comes into operation, see section 49.

Note:          For when a determination under this Part setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages comes into operation, see section 166.

            (2)  The specified day must not be earlier than the day on which the determination is made, unless:

                     (a)  the determination is made under section 160 (which deals with variation to remove ambiguities or correct errors); and

                     (b)  the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that justify specifying an earlier day.

Determinations take effect from first full pay period

            (3)  The determination does not take effect in relation to a particular employee until the start of the employee s first full pay period that starts on or after the day the determination comes into operation.

##### <a id="166"></a>166  When variation determinations setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages come into operation

Determinations generally come into operation on 1 July

            (1)  A determination under this Part that sets, varies or revokes modern award minimum wages comes into operation:

                     (a)  on 1 July in the next financial year after it is made; or

                     (b)  if it is made on 1 July in a financial year - on that day.

Note:          Modern award minimum wages can also be set, varied or revoked by determinations made in annual wage reviews. For when those determinations come into operation, see section 286.

FWC may specify another day of operation if appropriate

            (2)  However, if the FWC specifies another day in the determination as the day on which it comes into operation, the determination comes into operation on that other day. The FWC must not specify another day unless it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.

            (3)  The specified day must not be earlier than the day on which the determination is made, unless:

                     (a)  the determination is made under section 160 (which deals with variation to remove ambiguities or correct errors); and

                     (b)  the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that justify specifying an earlier day.

Determinations may take effect in stages

            (4)  The FWC may specify in the determination that changes to modern award minimum wages made by the determination take effect in stages if the FWC is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.

Determinations take effect from first full pay period

            (5)  A change to modern award minimum wages made by the determination does not take effect in relation to a particular employee until the start of the employee s first full pay period that starts on or after:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) applies - the day the determination comes into operation; or

                     (b)  if the determination takes effect in stages under subsection (4) - the day the change to modern award minimum wages is specified to take effect.

##### <a id="167"></a>167  Special rules relating to retrospective variations of awards

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies if a determination varying a modern award has a retrospective effect because it comes into operation under subsection 165(2) or 166(3) on a day before the day on which the determination is made.

No effect on past approval of enterprise agreement or variation

            (2)  If, before the determination was made, an enterprise agreement or a variation of an enterprise agreement was approved by the FWC, the validity of the approval is not affected by the retrospective effect of the determination.

No creation of liability to pay pecuniary penalty for past conduct

            (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person engaged in conduct before the determination was made; and

                     (b)  but for the retrospective effect of the determination, the conduct would not have contravened a term of the modern award or an enterprise agreement;

a court must not order the person to pay a pecuniary penalty under Division 2 of Part 4-1 in relation to the conduct, on the grounds that the conduct contravened a term of the modern award or enterprise agreement.

Note 1:       This subsection does not affect the powers of a court to make other kinds of orders under Division 2 of Part 4-1.

Note 2:       A determination varying a modern award could result in a contravention of a term of an enterprise agreement because of the effect of subsection 206(2).

##### <a id="168"></a>168  Varied modern award must be published

            (1)  If the FWC makes a determination under this Part or Part 2-6 (which deals with minimum  wages) varying a modern award, the FWC must publish the award as varied as soon as practicable.

            (2)  The publication may be on the FWC s website or by any other means that the FWC considers appropriate.

## Part 2-4 - Enterprise agreements

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="169"></a>169  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about enterprise agreements. An enterprise agreement is made at the enterprise level and provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. An enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.

Division 2 deals with the making of enterprise agreements about permitted matters. An enterprise agreement (including a greenfields agreement) may be a single-enterprise agreement or a multi-enterprise agreement.

Division 3 deals with the right of employees to be represented by a bargaining representative during bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. It also sets out the persons who are bargaining representatives for such agreements.

Subdivision A of Division 4 deals with the approval of proposed enterprise agreements by employees and sets out when an enterprise agreement is made.

Subdivision B of Division 4 deals with the approval of enterprise agreements by the FWC. The remaining Subdivisions of the Division deal with certain approval requirements, including in relation to genuine agreement by employees and the better off overall test.

Division 5 deals with the mandatory terms of enterprise agreements relating to individual flexibility arrangements and consultation requirements. 

Division 6 deals with the base rate of pay under an enterprise agreement.

Division 7 deals with the variation and termination of enterprise agreements.

Division 8 provides for the FWC to facilitate bargaining by making bargaining orders, serious breach declarations, majority support determinations and scope orders. It also permits bargaining representatives to apply for the FWC to deal with bargaining disputes.

Division 9 provides for the making of low-paid authorisations in relation to proposed multi-enterprise agreements. The effect of such an authorisation is that specified employers are subject to certain rules that would not otherwise apply (for example, bargaining orders that would not usually be available for multi-enterprise agreements will be available). It also permits the FWC to assist the bargaining representatives for such agreements.

Division 10 deals with single interest employer authorisations. The effect of such an authorisation is that the employers specified in the authorisation are single interest employers in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement.

Division 11 deals with other matters relating to enterprise agreements.

                   A bargaining representative for a proposed enterprise agreement may apply to the FWC for a declaration (a **_serious breach declaration_**) under section 235 in relation to the agreement.

Note:          The consequence of a serious breach declaration being made in relation to the agreement is that the FWC may, in certain circumstances, make a bargaining related workplace determination under section 269 in relation to the agreement.

          (3A)  If the agreement will not cover all of the employees of the employer or employers covered by the agreement, the FWC must, in deciding for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) whether the group of employees who will be covered was fairly chosen, take into account whether the group is geographically, operationally or organisationally distinct.

Operation of determination

            (4)  The determination comes into operation on the day on which it is made.

##### <a id="238"></a>238  Scope orders

Bargaining representatives may apply for scope orders

Matters which the FWC must take into account

          (4A)  If the agreement proposed to be specified in the scope order will not cover all of the employees of the employer or employers covered by the agreement, the FWC must, in deciding for the purposes of paragraph (4)(c) whether the group of employees who will be covered was fairly chosen, take into account whether the group is geographically, operationally or organisationally distinct.

### Division 9 - Low-paid bargaining

##### <a id="241"></a>241  Objects of this Division

                   The objects of this Division are:

                     (a)  to assist and encourage low-paid employees and their employers, who have not historically had the benefits of collective bargaining, to make an enterprise agreement that meets their needs; and

                     (b)  to assist low-paid employees and their employers to identify improvements to productivity and service delivery through bargaining for an enterprise agreement that covers 2 or more employers, while taking into account the specific needs of individual enterprises; and

                     (c)  to address constraints on the ability of low-paid employees and their employers to bargain at the enterprise level, including constraints relating to a lack of skills, resources, bargaining strength or previous bargaining experience; and

                     (d)  to enable the FWC to provide assistance to low-paid employees and their employers to facilitate bargaining for enterprise agreements.

Note:          A low-paid workplace determination may be made in specified circumstances under Division 2 of Part 2-5 if the bargaining representatives for a proposed enterprise agreement in relation to which a low-paid authorisation is in operation are unable to reach agreement.

##### <a id="242"></a>242  Low-paid authorisations

            (1)  The following persons may apply to the FWC for an authorisation (a **_low-paid authorisation_**) under section 243 in relation to a proposed multi-enterprise agreement:

                     (a)  a bargaining representative for the agreement;

                     (b)  an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee in relation to work to be performed under the agreement.

Note:          The effect of a low-paid authorisation is that the employers specified in it are subject to certain rules in relation to the agreement that would not otherwise apply (such as in relation to the availability of bargaining orders, see subsection 229(2)).

            (2)  The application must specify:

                     (a)  the employers that will be covered by the agreement; and

                     (b)  the employees who will be covered by the agreement.

            (3)  An application under this section must not be made in relation to a proposed greenfields agreement.

##### <a id="243"></a>243  When the FWC must make a low-paid authorisation

Low-paid authorisation

            (1)  The FWC must make a low-paid authorisation in relation to a proposed multi-enterprise agreement if:

                     (a)  an application for the authorisation has been made; and

                     (b)  the FWC is satisfied that it is in the public interest to make the authorisation, taking into account the matters specified in subsections (2) and (3).

FWC must take into account historical and current matters relating to collective bargaining

            (2)  In deciding whether or not to make the authorisation, the FWC must take into account the following:

                     (a)  whether granting the authorisation would assist low-paid employees who have not had access to collective bargaining or who face substantial difficulty bargaining at the enterprise level;

                     (b)  the history of bargaining in the industry in which the employees who will be covered by the agreement work;

                     (c)  the relative bargaining strength of the employers and employees who will be covered by the agreement;

                     (d)  the current terms and conditions of employment of the employees who will be covered by the agreement, as compared to relevant industry and community standards;

                     (e)  the degree of commonality in the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement relates, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises.

FWC must take into account matters relating to the likely success of collective bargaining

            (3)  In deciding whether or not to make the authorisation, the FWC must also take into account the following:

                     (a)  whether granting the authorisation would assist in identifying improvements to productivity and service delivery at the enterprises to which the agreement relates;

                     (b)  the extent to which the likely number of bargaining representatives for the agreement would be consistent with a manageable collective bargaining process;

                     (c)  the views of the employers and employees who will be covered by the agreement;

                     (d)  the extent to which the terms and conditions of employment of the employees who will be covered by the agreement is controlled, directed or influenced by a person other than the employer, or employers, that will be covered by the agreement;

                     (e)  the extent to which the applicant for the authorisation is prepared to consider and respond reasonably to claims, or responses to claims, that may be made by a particular employer named in the application, if that employer later proposes to bargain for an agreement that:

                             (i)  would cover that employer; and

                            (ii)  would not cover the other employers specified in the application.

What authorisation must specify etc.

            (4)  The authorisation must specify:

                     (a)  the employers that will be covered by the agreement (which may be some or all of the employers specified in the application); and

                     (b)  the employees who will be covered by the agreement (which may be some or all of the employees specified in the application); and

                     (c)  any other matter prescribed by the procedural rules.

Operation of authorisation

            (5)  The authorisation comes into operation on the day on which it is made.

##### <a id="244"></a>244  Variation of low-paid authorisations - general

Variation to remove employer

            (1)  An employer specified in a low-paid authorisation may apply to the FWC for a variation of the authorisation to remove the employer s name from the authorisation.

            (2)  If an application is made under subsection (1), the FWC must vary the authorisation to remove the employer s name if the FWC is satisfied that, because of a change in the employer s circumstances, it is no longer appropriate for the employer to be specified in the authorisation.

Variation to add employer

            (3)  The following may apply to the FWC for a variation of a low-paid authorisation to add the name of an employer that is not specified in the authorisation:

                     (a)  the employer;

                     (b)  a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by the proposed multi-enterprise agreement to which the authorisation relates;

                     (c)  an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee in relation to work to be performed under that agreement.

            (4)  If an application is made under subsection (3), the FWC must vary the authorisation to add the employer s name if the FWC is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, taking into account the matters specified in subsections 243(2) and (3).

##### <a id="245"></a>245  Variation of low-paid authorisations - enterprise agreement etc. comes into operation

                   The FWC is taken to have varied a low-paid authorisation to remove an employer s name when an enterprise agreement, or a workplace determination, that covers the employer comes into operation.

##### <a id="246"></a>246  FWC s assistance for the low-paid

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies if a low-paid authorisation is in operation in relation to a proposed multi-enterprise agreement.

FWC s assistance

            (2)  The FWC may, on its own initiative, provide to the bargaining representatives for the agreement such assistance:

                     (a)  that the FWC considers appropriate to facilitate bargaining for the agreement; and

                     (b)  that the FWC could provide if it were dealing with a dispute.

Note:          This section does not empower the FWC to arbitrate, because subsection 595(3) provides that the FWC may arbitrate only if expressly authorised to do so.

FWC may direct a person to attend a conference

            (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), the FWC may provide assistance by directing a person who is not an employer specified in the authorisation to attend a conference at a specified time and place if the FWC is satisfied that the person exercises such a degree of control over the terms and conditions of the employees who will be covered by the agreement that the participation of the person in bargaining is necessary for the agreement to be made.

            (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit the FWC s powers under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part 5-1.

### Division 10 - Single interest employer authorisations

Application for declaration

            (1)  Two or more employers that will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement may apply to the Minister for a declaration under subsection (3).

Note:          Employers named in a declaration may apply for a single interest employer authorisation (see Subdivision B of this Division).

            (2)  The application must specify the employers (the **_relevant employers_**) that will be covered by the agreement.

Declaration by the Minister

            (3)  If an application is made under subsection (1), the Minister may declare, in writing, that the relevant employers may bargain together for the agreement.

            (4)  In deciding whether or not to make the declaration, the Minister must take into account the following matters:

                     (a)  the history of bargaining of each of the relevant employers, including whether they have previously bargained together;

                     (b)  the interests that the relevant employers have in common, and the extent to which those interests are relevant to whether they should be permitted to bargain together;

                     (c)  whether the relevant employers are governed by a common regulatory regime;

                     (d)  whether it would be more appropriate for each of the relevant employers to make a separate enterprise agreement with its employees;

                     (e)  the extent to which the relevant employers operate collaboratively rather than competitively;

                      (f)  whether the relevant employers are substantially funded, directly or indirectly, by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory;

                     (g)  any other matter the Minister considers relevant.

            (5)  If the Minister decides to make the declaration, the relevant employers must be specified in the declaration.

            (1)  Two or more employers may apply to the FWC for an authorisation (a **_single interest employer authorisation_**) under section 249 in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement.

Note:          The effect of a single interest employer authorisation is that the employers are single interest employers in relation to the agreement (see paragraph 172(5)(c)).

            (2)  The application must specify the following:

                     (a)  the employers that will be covered by the agreement;

                     (b)  the employees who will be covered by the agreement;

                     (c)  the person (if any) nominated by the employers to make applications under this Act if the authorisation is made.

                     (c)  the person (if any) nominated by the employers to make applications under this Act if the authorisation is made;

                     (d)  any other matter prescribed by the procedural rules.

Authorisation may relate to only some of employers or employees

            (2)  If the FWC is satisfied of the matters specified in subsection 249(2) or (3) (which deal with franchisees and employers that may bargain together for a proposed enterprise agreement) in relation to only some of the employers that will be covered by the agreement, the FWC may make a single interest employer authorisation specifying those employers and their employees only.

##### <a id="251"></a>251  Variation of single interest employer authorisations

Variation to remove employer

            (1)  An employer specified in a single interest employer authorisation in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement may apply to the FWC for a variation of the authorisation to remove the employer s name from the authorisation.

            (2)  If an application is made under subsection (1), the FWC must vary the authorisation to remove the employer s name if the FWC is satisfied that, because of a change in the employer s circumstances, it is no longer appropriate for the employer to be specified in the authorisation.

Variation to add employer

            (3)  An employer that is not specified in a single interest employer authorisation may apply to the FWC for a variation of the authorisation to add the employer s name to the authorisation.

            (4)  If an application is made under subsection (3), the FWC must vary the authorisation to add the employer s name if the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (b)  no person coerced, or threatened to coerce, the employer to make the application; and

                     (c)  the requirements of subsection 249(2) or (3) (which deal with franchisees and employers that may bargain together for a proposed enterprise agreement) are met.

            (1)  A bargaining representative for a proposed enterprise agreement to which a single interest employer authorisation relates may apply to the FWC to vary the authorisation to extend the period for which the authorisation is in operation.

            (2)  The FWC may vary the authorisation to extend the period if the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (a)  there are reasonable prospects that the agreement will be made if the authorisation is in operation for a longer period; and

                     (b)  it is appropriate in all the circumstances to extend the period.

### Division 11 - Other matters

##### <a id="253"></a>253  Terms of an enterprise agreement that are of no effect

            (1)  A term of an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that:

                     (a)  it is not a term about a permitted matter; or

                     (b)  it is an unlawful term; or

                     (c)  it is a designated outworker term.

Note 1:       A term of an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that it contravenes section 55 (see section 56).

Note 2:       A term of an enterprise agreement permitting or requiring deductions or payments to be made has no effect if it benefits the employer and is unreasonable in the circumstances (see section 326).

            (2)  However, if an enterprise agreement includes a term that has no effect because of subsection (1), or section 56 or 326, the inclusion of the term does not prevent the agreement from being an enterprise agreement.

##### <a id="254"></a>254  Applications by bargaining representatives

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies if a provision of this Part permits an application to be made by a bargaining representative of an employer that will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement.

Persons who may make applications

## Part 2-5 - Workplace determinations

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="258"></a>258  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part is about workplace determinations, which provide terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom they apply.

Division 2 deals with low-paid workplace determinations. Bargaining representatives for a proposed multi-enterprise agreement may apply to the FWC for such a determination if they are unable to reach agreement on the terms that should be included in the agreement.

Division 3 deals with industrial action related workplace determinations. The FWC must make such a determination if:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   a termination of industrial
action instrument is made in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   after the end of the post-industrial
action negotiating period, the bargaining representatives for the agreement
have not settled the matters that were at issue during bargaining for the
agreement.</li>

Division 4 deals with bargaining related workplace determinations. The FWC must make such a determination if:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   a serious breach declaration
is made in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement; and</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   after the end of the post-declaration
negotiating period, the bargaining representatives for the agreement have not
settled the matters that were at issue during bargaining for the agreement.</li>

Division 5 sets out the core terms, mandatory terms and agreed terms of workplace determinations. It also sets out the factors that the FWC must take into account in deciding the terms of a workplace determination.

Division 6 deals with the operation, coverage and interaction etc. of workplace determinations. It also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, this Act applies to a workplace determination that is in operation as if it were an enterprise agreement that is in operation.

Division 7 deals with contraventions of workplace determinations and other matters relating to applications by bargaining representatives.

            (4)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), a workplace determination that has ceased to operate does not **_cover_** an employer, employee or employee organisation.

Workplace determinations cover employees in relation to particular employment

            (5)  A reference in this Act to a workplace determination covering an employee is a reference to the determination covering the employee in relation to particular employment.

##### <a id="278"></a>278  Interaction of a workplace determination with enterprise agreements etc.

Interaction with an enterprise agreement

            (1)  If:

                     (a)  a workplace determination applies to an employee in relation to particular employment; and

                     (b)  an enterprise agreement that covers the employee in relation to the same employment comes into operation;

the determination ceases to apply to the employee in relation to that employment, and can never so apply again.

Interaction with another workplace determination

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  a workplace determination (the **_earlier determination_**) applies to an employee in relation to particular employment; and

                     (b)  another workplace determination (the **_later determination_**) that covers the employee in relation to the same employment comes into operation;

the earlier determination ceases to apply to the employee in relation to that employment when the later determination comes into operation, and can never so apply again.

##### <a id="279"></a>279  Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement

            (1)  This Act applies to a workplace determination that is in operation as if it were an enterprise agreement that is in operation.

            (2)  However, the following provisions do not apply to the determination:

                     (a)  section 50 (which deals with contraventions of enterprise agreements);

                     (b)  section 53 (which deals with the coverage of enterprise agreements);

                     (c)  section 54 (which deals with the operation of enterprise agreements); 

                     (d)  section 58 (which deals with the interaction between one or more enterprise agreements); 

                     (e)  section 183 (which deals with the entitlement of employee organisations to be covered by enterprise agreements);

                      (f)  the provisions of Subdivisions A and B of Division 7 of Part 2-4 (which deal with the variation of enterprise agreements) other than section 218 (which deals with variation of an enterprise agreement on referral by the Australian Human Rights Commission).

            (3)  In addition, Subdivision C of Division 7 of Part 2-4 (which deals with the termination of enterprise agreements by employers and employees) only applies to a workplace determination after the determination has passed its nominal expiry date.

### Division 7 - Other matters

##### <a id="280"></a>280  Contravening a workplace determination

                   A person must not contravene a term of a workplace determination.

Note 1:       This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       A person does not contravene a term of a workplace determination unless the determination applies to the person: see subsections 51(1) and 279(1).

##### <a id="281"></a>281  Applications by bargaining representatives

Application of this section

            (1)  This section applies if a provision of this Part permits an application to be made by a bargaining representative of an employer that would have been covered by a proposed enterprise agreement.

Persons who may make applications

            (2)  If the agreement would have covered more than one employer, the application may be made by:

                     (a)  in the case of a proposed enterprise agreement in relation to which a single interest employer authorisation is in operation - the person (if any) specified in the authorisation as the person who may make applications under this Act; or

                     (b)  in any case - a bargaining representative of an employer that would have been covered by the agreement, on behalf of one or more other such bargaining representatives, if those other bargaining representatives have agreed to the application being made on their behalf.

##### <a id="281A"></a>281A  How employees, employers and employee organisations are to be described

            (1)  This section applies if a provision of this Part requires or permits an instrument of any kind to specify the employers, employees or employee organisations covered, or who will be covered, by a workplace determination or other instrument.

            (2)  The employees may be specified by class or by name.

            (3)  The employers and employee organisations must be specified by name.

            (4)  Without limiting the way in which a class may be described for the purposes of subsection (2), the class may be described by reference to one or more of the following:

                     (a)  a particular industry or part of an industry;

                     (b)  a particular kind of work;

## Part 2-6 - Minimum wages

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="282"></a>282  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part provides for the FWC (constituted by the Minimum Wage Panel) to set and vary minimum wages for national system employees. For employees covered by modern awards, minimum wages are specified in the modern award. For award/agreement free employees, minimum wages are specified in the national minimum wage order.

Division 2 provides for the minimum wages objective. This requires the FWC to establish and maintain a safety net of fair minimum wages, taking into account certain social and economic factors.

Division 3 provides for the FWC (constituted by the Minimum Wage Panel) to conduct annual wage reviews. In an annual wage review, the FWC may set or vary minimum wages in modern awards, and must make a national minimum wage order. Minimum wages in modern awards can also be set, or varied (in limited circumstances), under Part 2-3 (which deals with modern awards).

Division 4 provides for national minimum wage orders and requires employers to comply with them. The orders set the national minimum wage, as well as special national minimum wages for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability. The orders also set the casual loading for award/agreement free employees.

National minimum wages and special national minimum wages apply to award/agreement free employees. However, they are also relevant to other employees as follows:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   in setting or varying modern
award minimum wages, the FWC must take the national minimum wage into account
(see subsection 135(2) (in Part 2-3) and subsection 285(3) (in this
Part));</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   for an employee who is not
covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the
employee s base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the
relevant national minimum wage or special national minimum wage (see subsection
206(3) (in Part 2-4)).</li>

For an employee who is covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee s base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the base rate of pay that would have been payable to the employee if the award applied (see subsection 206(1) (in Part 2-4)).

* * *

##### <a id="283"></a>283  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

                   In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

Note:          See also Division 2 of Part 6-4A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

### Division 2 - Overarching provisions

##### <a id="284"></a>284  The minimum wages objective

What is the minimum wages objective?

            (1)  The FWC must establish and maintain a safety net of fair minimum wages, taking into account:

                     (a)  the performance and competitiveness of the national economy, including productivity, business competitiveness and viability, inflation and employment growth; and

                     (b)  promoting social inclusion through increased workforce participation; and

                     (c)  relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and

                     (d)  the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value; and

                     (e)  providing a comprehensive range of fair minimum wages to junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability.

This is the **_minimum wages objective_**.

When does the minimum wages objective apply?

            (2)  The minimum wages objective applies to the performance or exercise of:

                     (a)  the FWC s functions or powers under this Part; and

                     (b)  the FWC s functions or powers under Part 2-3, so far as they relate to setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages.

Note:          The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the modern awards objective also applies (see section 134).

Meaning of **modern award minimum wages**

            (3)  **_Modern award minimum wages_** are the rates of minimum wages in modern awards, including:

                     (a)  wage rates for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability; and

                     (b)  casual loadings; and

                     (c)  piece rates.

Meaning of **setting** and **varying** modern award minimum wages

            (4)  **_Setting_** modern award minimum wages is the initial setting of one or more new modern award minimum wages in a modern award, either in the award as originally made or by a later variation of the award. **_Varying_** modern award minimum wages is varying the current rate of one or more modern award minimum wages.

### Division 3 - Annual wage reviews

#### Subdivision A - Main provisions

##### <a id="285"></a>285  Annual wage reviews to be conducted

            (1)  The FWC must conduct and complete an **_annual wage review_** in each financial year.

Note 1:       The FWC must be constituted by the Minimum Wage Panel to conduct annual wage reviews, and to make determinations and orders in those reviews (see section 617).

Note 2:       The President may give directions about the conduct of annual wage reviews (see section 582).

            (2)  In an annual wage review, the FWC:

                            (ii)  the national minimum wage order; and

                     (b)  may make one or more determinations  varying modern awards to set, vary or revoke modern award minimum wages; and

                     (c)  must make a national minimum wage order.

Note:          For provisions about national minimum wage orders, see Division 4.

            (3)  In exercising its power in an annual wage review to make determinations referred to in paragraph (2)(b), the FWC must take into account the rate of the national minimum wage that it proposes to set in the review.

##### <a id="286"></a>286  When annual wage review determinations varying modern awards come into operation

Determinations generally come into operation on 1 July

            (1)  A determination (a **_variation determination_**) varying one or more modern awards to set, vary or revoke modern award minimum wages that is made in an annual wage review comes into operation on 1 July in the next financial year.

Later operation of determinations in exceptional circumstances

            (2)  If the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying why a variation determination should not come into operation until a later day, the FWC may specify that later day as the day on which it comes into operation. However, the determination must be limited just to the particular situation to which the exceptional circumstances relate.

Note:          This may mean that the FWC needs to make more than one determination, if different circumstances apply to different employees.

            (3)  If a later day is so specified, the variation determination comes into operation on that later day.

Effect of determinations cannot be deferred

            (4)  The FWC cannot provide for the effect of a variation determination on modern award minimum wages to be deferred to a day that is later than the day on which the determination comes into operation.

Determinations take effect from first full pay period

            (5)  A variation determination does not take effect in relation to a particular employee until the start of the employee s first full pay period that starts on or after the day the determination comes into operation.

##### <a id="287"></a>287  When national minimum wage orders come into operation etc.

Orders come into operation on 1 July

            (1)  A national minimum wage order that is made in an annual wage review comes into operation on 1 July in the next financial year (the **_year of operation_**).

Setting of different wages or loadings only permitted in exceptional circumstances

            (2)  The national minimum wage or the casual loading for award/agreement free employees set by the order must be the same for all employees, unless:

                     (a)  the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying setting different wages or loadings; and

                     (b)  the setting of different wages or loadings is limited just to the extent necessary because of the particular situation to which the exceptional circumstances relate.

            (3)  A special national minimum wage set by the order for a specified class of employees must be the same for all employees in that class, unless:

                     (a)  the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying setting different wages; and

                     (b)  the setting of different wages is limited just to the extent necessary because of the particular situation to which the exceptional circumstances relate.

Adjustments taking effect during year of operation only permitted in exceptional circumstances

            (4)  The order may provide that an adjustment of the national minimum wage, the casual loading for award/agreement free employees, or a special national minimum wage, set by the order takes effect (whether for some or all employees to whom that wage or loading applies) on a specified day in the year of operation that is later than 1 July, but only if:

                     (a)  the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the adjustment taking effect on that day; and

                     (b)  the adjustment is limited just to the particular situation to which the exceptional circumstances relate.

When orders take effect

            (5)  The order takes effect in relation to a particular employee from the start of the employee s first full pay period that starts on or after 1 July in the year of operation. However, an adjustment referred to in subsection (4) takes effect in relation to a particular employee from the start of the employee s first full pay period that starts on or after the day specified as referred to in that subsection.

##### <a id="306"></a>306  Inconsistency with modern awards, enterprise agreements and orders of the FWC

                   A term of a modern award, an enterprise agreement or an FWC order has no effect in relation to an employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of an equal remuneration order that applies to the employee.

## Part 2-8 - Transfer of business

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="307"></a>307  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part provides for the transfer of enterprise agreements, certain modern awards and certain other instruments if there is a transfer of business from one national system employer to another national system employer. (For a transfer of business from a non-national system employer that is a State public sector employer to a national system employer, see Part 6-3A.)

Division 2 describes when a transfer of business occurs and defines the following key concepts: **_old employer_**, **_new employer_**, **_transferring work_**, **_transferring employee_** and **_transferable instrument_**.

Division 2 also sets out the circumstances in which enterprise agreements, certain modern awards and certain other instruments that covered the old employer and the transferring employees (including high income employees) cover the new employer, the transferring employees and certain non-transferring employees and organisations.

Division 3 provides for the FWC to make orders in relation to a transfer of business.

##### <a id="308"></a>308  Meanings of _employee_ and _employer_

                   In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

Note:          See also Division 2 of Part 6-4A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

##### <a id="309"></a>309  Object of this Part

                   The object of this Part is to provide a balance between:

                     (a)  the protection of employees  terms and conditions of employment under enterprise agreements, certain modern awards and certain other instruments; and

                     (b)  the interests of employers in running their enterprises efficiently;

if there is a transfer of business from one employer to another employer.

### Division 2 - Transfer of instruments

##### <a id="310"></a>310  Application of this Division

                   This Division provides for the transfer of rights and obligations under enterprise agreements, certain modern awards and certain other instruments if there is a transfer of business from an old employer to a new employer.

##### <a id="311"></a>311  When does a transfer of business occur

Meanings of **transfer of business**, **old employer**, **new employer** and **transferring work**

            (1)  There is a **_transfer of business_** from an employer (the **_old employer_**) to another employer (the **_new employer_**) if the following requirements are satisfied:

                     (a)  the employment of an employee of the old employer has terminated;

                     (b)  within 3 months after the termination, the employee becomes employed by the new employer;

                     (c)  the work (the **_transferring work_**) the employee performs for the new employer is the same, or substantially the same, as the work the employee performed for the old employer;

                     (d)  there is a connection between the old employer and the new employer as described in any of subsections (3) to (6).

Meaning of **transferring employee**

            (2)  An employee in relation to whom the requirements in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied is a **_transferring employee_** in relation to the transfer of business.

Transfer of assets from old employer to new employer

            (3)  There is a connection between the old employer and the new employer if, in accordance with an arrangement between:

                     (a)  the old employer or an associated entity of the old employer; and

                     (b)  the new employer or an associated entity of the new employer;

the new employer, or the associated entity of the new employer, owns or has the beneficial use of some or all of the assets (whether tangible or intangible):

                     (c)  that the old employer, or the associated entity of the old employer, owned or had the beneficial use of; and

                     (d)  that relate to, or are used in connection with, the transferring work.

Old employer outsources work to new employer

            (4)  There is a connection between the old employer and the new employer if the transferring work is performed by one or more transferring employees, as employees of the new employer, because the old employer, or an associated entity of the old employer, has outsourced the transferring work to the new employer or an associated entity of the new employer.

New employer ceases to outsource work to old employer

            (5)  There is a connection between the old employer and the new employer if:

                     (a)  the transferring work had been performed by one or more transferring employees, as employees of the old employer, because the new employer, or an associated entity of the new employer, had outsourced the transferring work to the old employer or an associated entity of the old employer; and

                     (b)  the transferring work is performed by those transferring employees, as employees of the new employer, because the new employer, or the associated entity of the new employer, has ceased to outsource the work to the old employer or the associated entity of the old employer.

New employer is associated entity of old employer

            (6)  There is a connection between the old employer and the new employer if the new employer is an associated entity of the old employer when the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer.

##### <a id="312"></a>312  Instruments that may transfer

Meaning of **transferable instrument**

            (1)  Each of the following is a **_transferable instrument_**:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement that has been approved by the FWC;

                     (b)  a workplace determination;

                     (c)  a named employer award.

Meaning of **named employer award**

            (2)  Each of the following is a **_named employer award_**:

                     (a)  a modern award (including a modern enterprise award) that is expressed to cover one or more named employers;

                     (b)  a modern enterprise award that is expressed to cover one or more specified classes of employers (other than a modern enterprise award that is expressed to relate to one or more enterprises as described in paragraph 168A(2)(b)).

Note:          Paragraph 168A(2)(b) deals with employers that carry on similar business activities under the same franchise.

##### <a id="313"></a>313  Transferring employees and new employer covered by transferable instrument

            (1)  If a transferable instrument covered the old employer and a transferring employee immediately before the termination of the transferring employee s employment with the old employer, then:

                     (a)  the transferable instrument covers the new employer and the transferring employee in relation to the transferring work after the time (the **_transfer time_**) the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer; and

                     (b)  while the transferable instrument covers the new employer and the transferring employee in relation to the transferring work, no other enterprise agreement or named employer award that covers the new employer at the transfer time covers the transferring employee in relation to that work.

            (2)  To avoid doubt, a transferable instrument that covers the new employer and a transferring employee under paragraph (1)(a) includes any individual flexibility arrangement that had effect as a term of the transferable instrument immediately before the termination of the transferring employee s employment with the old employer.

            (3)  This section has effect subject to any FWC order under subsection 318(1).

##### <a id="314"></a>314  New non-transferring employees of new employer may be covered by transferable instrument

            (1)  If:

                     (a)  a transferable instrument covers the new employer because of paragraph 313(1)(a); and

                     (b)  after the transferable instrument starts to cover the new employer, the new employer employs a non-transferring employee; and

                     (c)  the non-transferring employee performs the transferring work; and

                     (d)  at the time the non-transferring employee is employed, no other enterprise agreement or modern award covers the new employer and the non-transferring employee in relation to that work;

then the transferable instrument covers the new employer and the non-transferring employee in relation to that work.

            (2)  A **_non-transferring employee_** of a new employer, in relation to a transfer of business, is an employee of the new employer who is not a transferring employee.

            (3)  This section has effect subject to any FWC order under subsection 319(1).

##### <a id="315"></a>315  Organisations covered by transferable instrument

Employer organisation covered by named employer award

            (1)  If:

                     (a)  a named employer award covers the new employer because of paragraph 313(1)(a); and

                     (b)  the named employer award covered an employer organisation in relation to the old employer immediately before the termination of a transferring employee s employment with the old employer;

then the named employer award covers the employer organisation in relation to the new employer.

Employee organisation covered by named employer award

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  a named employer award covers the new employer and a transferring employee because of paragraph 313(1)(a); and

                     (b)  the named employer award covered an employee organisation in relation to the transferring employee immediately before the termination of the transferring employee s employment with the old employer;

then the named employer award covers the employee organisation in relation to:

                     (c)  the transferring employee; and

                     (d)  any non-transferring employee of the new employer who:

                             (i)  is covered by the named employer award because of a provision of this Part or an FWC order; and

                            (ii)  performs the same work as the transferring employee.

Employee organisation covered by enterprise agreement

            (3)  To avoid doubt, if:

                     (a)  an enterprise agreement covers a transferring employee or a non-transferring employee because of a provision of this Part or an FWC order; and

                     (b)  the enterprise agreement covered an employee organisation immediately before the termination of the transferring employee s employment with the old employer;

then the enterprise agreement covers the employee organisation.

##### <a id="316"></a>316  Transferring employees who are high income employees

            (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the old employer had given a guarantee of annual earnings for a guaranteed period to a transferring employee; and

                     (b)  the transferring employee was a high income employee immediately before the termination of the transferring employee s employment with the old employer; and

                     (c)  some of the guaranteed period occurs after the time (the **_transfer time_**) the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer; and

                     (d)  an enterprise agreement does not apply to the transferring employee in relation to the transferring work at the transfer time.

            (2)  The guarantee of annual earnings has effect after the transfer time (except as provided in this section) as if it had been given to the transferring employee by the new employer.

            (3)  The new employer is not required to comply with the guarantee of annual earnings in relation to any part of the guaranteed period before the transfer time.

            (4)  The new employer is not required to comply with the guarantee of annual earnings to the extent that it requires the new employer to pay an amount of earnings to the transferring employee, in relation to the part of the guaranteed period after the transfer time, at a rate that is more than the annual rate of the guarantee of annual earnings.

            (5)  If:

                     (a)  the transferring employee is entitled to non-monetary benefits under the guarantee of annual earnings after the transfer time; and

                     (b)  it is not practicable for the new employer to provide those benefits to the transferring employee;

then the guarantee of annual earnings is taken to be varied so that, instead of the entitlement to those benefits, the transferring employee is entitled to an amount of money that is equivalent to the agreed money value of those benefits.

            (6)  This section does not affect the rights and obligations of the old employer that arose before the transfer time in relation to the guarantee of annual earnings.

Who may apply for a variation

            (3)  The FWC may make the variation only on application by:

                     (a)  a person who is, or is likely to be, covered by the transferable instrument; or

### Division 3 - Guarantee of annual earnings

##### <a id="328"></a>328  Employer obligations in relation to guarantee of annual earnings

Employer must comply with guarantee

            (1)  An employer that has given a guarantee of annual earnings to an employee must (subject to any reductions arising from circumstances in which the employer is required or entitled to reduce the employee s earnings) comply with the guarantee during any period during which the employee:

                     (a)  is a high income employee of the employer; and

                     (b)  is covered by a modern award that is in operation.

Note 1:       Examples of circumstances in which the employer is required or entitled to reduce the employee s earnings are unpaid leave or absence, and periods of industrial action (see Division 9 of Part 3-3).

Note 2:       This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Employer must comply with guarantee for period before termination

            (2)  If:

                     (a)  the employment of a high income employee is terminated before the end of the guaranteed period; and

                     (b)  either or both of the following apply:

                             (i)  the employer terminates the employment;

                            (ii)  the employee becomes a transferring employee in relation to a transfer of business from the employer to a new employer, and the guarantee of annual earnings has effect under subsection 316(2) as if it had been given to the employee by the new employer; and

                     (c)  the employee is covered by a modern award that is in operation at the time of the termination;

the employer must pay earnings to the employee in relation to the part of the guaranteed period before the termination at the annual rate of the guarantee of annual earnings.

Note:          This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Employer must give notice of consequences

            (3)  Before or at the time of giving a guarantee of annual earnings to an employee covered by a modern award that is in operation, an employer must notify the employee in writing that a modern award will not apply to the employee during any period during which the annual rate of the guarantee of annual earnings exceeds the high income threshold.

Note:          This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

##### <a id="329"></a>329  High income employee

            (1)  A full-time employee is a **_high income employee_** of an employer at a time if:

                     (a)  the employee has a guarantee of annual earnings for the guaranteed period; and

                     (b)  the time occurs during the period; and

                     (c)  the annual rate of the guarantee of annual earnings exceeds the high income threshold at that time.

            (2)  An employee other than a full-time employee is a **_high-income employee_** of an employer at a time if:

                     (a)  the employee has a guarantee of annual earnings for the guaranteed period; and

                     (b)  the time occurs during the period; and

                     (c)  the annual rate of the guarantee of annual earnings would have exceeded the high income threshold at that time if the employee were employed on a full-time basis at the same rate of earnings.

            (3)  To avoid doubt, the employee does not have a guarantee of annual earnings for the guaranteed period if the employer revokes the guarantee of annual earnings with the employee s agreement.

##### <a id="330"></a>330  Guarantee of annual earnings and annual rate of guarantee

            (1)  An undertaking given by an employer to an employee is a **_guarantee of annual earnings_** if:

                     (a)  the employee is covered by a modern award that is in operation; and

                     (b)  the undertaking is an undertaking in writing to pay the employee an amount of earnings in relation to the performance of work during a period of 12 months or more; and

                     (c)  the employee agrees to accept the undertaking, and agrees with the amount of the earnings; and

                     (d)  the undertaking and the employee s agreement are given before the start of the period, and within 14 days after:

                             (i)  the day the employee is employed; or

                            (ii)  a day on which the employer and employee agree to vary the terms and conditions of the employee s employment; and

                     (e)  an enterprise agreement does not apply to the employee s employment at the start of the period.

            (2)  However, if:

                     (a)  an employee is employed for a period shorter than 12 months; or

                     (b)  an employee will perform duties of a particular kind for a period shorter than 12 months;

the undertaking may be given for that shorter period.

            (3)  The **_annual rate_** of the guarantee of annual earnings is the annual rate of the earnings covered by the undertaking.

##### <a id="331"></a>331  Guaranteed period

                   The **_guaranteed period_** for a guarantee of annual earnings is the period that:

                     (a)  starts at the start of the period of the undertaking that is the guarantee of annual earnings; and

                     (b)  ends at the earliest of the following:

                             (i)  the end of that period;

                            (ii)  an enterprise agreement starting to apply to the employment of the employee;

                           (iii)  the employer revoking the guarantee of annual earnings with the employee s agreement.

##### <a id="332"></a>332  Earnings

            (1)  An employee s **_earnings_** include:

                     (a)  the employee s wages; and

                     (b)  amounts applied or dealt with in any way on the employee s behalf or as the employee directs; and

                     (c)  the agreed money value of non-monetary benefits; and

                     (d)  amounts or benefits prescribed by the regulations.

            (2)  However, an employee s **_earnings_** do not include the following:

                     (a)  payments the amount of which cannot be determined in advance;

                     (b)  reimbursements;

                     (c)  contributions to a superannuation fund to the extent that they are contributions to which subsection (4) applies;

                     (d)  amounts prescribed by the regulations.

Note:          Some examples of payments covered by paragraph (a) are commissions, incentive-based payments and bonuses, and overtime (unless the overtime is guaranteed).

            (3)  **_Non-monetary benefits_** are benefits other than an entitlement to a payment of money:

                     (a)  to which the employee is entitled in return for the performance of work; and

                     (b)  for which a reasonable money value has been agreed by the employee and the employer;

but does not include a benefit prescribed by the regulations.

            (4)  This subsection applies to contributions that the employer makes to a superannuation fund to the extent that one or more of the following applies:

                     (a)  the employer would have been liable to pay superannuation guarantee charge under the _Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act 1992_ in relation to the person if the amounts had not been so contributed;

                     (b)  the employer is required to contribute to the fund for the employee s benefit in relation to a defined benefit interest (within the meaning of section 292-175 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) of the employee;

                     (c)  the employer is required to contribute to the fund for the employee s benefit under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

##### <a id="333"></a>333  High income threshold

            (1)  Subject to this section, the **_high income threshold_** is the amount prescribed by, or worked out in the manner prescribed by, the regulations.

            (2)  A regulation made for the purposes of subsection (1) has no effect to the extent that it would have the effect of reducing the amount of the high income threshold.

            (3)  If:

                     (a)  in prescribing a manner in which the high income threshold is worked out, regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) specify a particular matter or state of affairs; and

                     (b)  as a result of a change in the matter or state of affairs, the amount of the high income threshold worked out in that manner would, but for this subsection, be less than it was on the last occasion on which this subsection did not apply;

the **_high income threshold_** is the amount that it would be if the change had not occurred.

##### <a id="333A"></a>333A  Prospective employees

                   If:

                     (a)  an employer, or a person who may become an employer, gives to another person an undertaking that would have been a guarantee of annual earnings if the other person had been the employer s or person s employee; and

                     (b)  the other person subsequently becomes the employer s or person s employee; and

                     (c)  the undertaking relates to the work that the other person performs for the employer or person;

this Division applies in relation to the undertaking, after the other person becomes the employer s or person s employee, as if the other person had been the employer s or person s employee at the time the undertaking was given.

                   In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

Note:          See also Division 2 of Part 6-4A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

##### <a id="381"></a>381  Object of this Part

            (1)  The object of this Part is:

                     (a)  to establish a framework for dealing with unfair dismissal that balances:

                             (i)  the needs of business (including small business); and

                            (ii)  the needs of employees; and

                     (b)  to establish procedures for dealing with unfair dismissal that:

                             (i)  are quick, flexible and informal; and

                            (ii)  address the needs of employers and employees; and

                     (c)  to provide remedies if a dismissal is found to be unfair, with an emphasis on reinstatement.

            (2)  The procedures and remedies referred to in paragraphs (1)(b) and (c), and the manner of deciding on and working out such remedies, are intended to ensure that a  fair go all round  is accorded to both the employer and employee concerned.

Note:          The expression  fair go all round  was used by Sheldon J in _in re Loty and Holloway v Australian Workers  Union_ \[1971] AR (NSW) 95.

### Division 2 - Protection from unfair dismissal

##### <a id="382"></a>382  When a person is protected from unfair dismissal

                   A person is **_protected from unfair dismissal_** at a time if, at that time:

                     (a)  the person is an employee who has completed a period of employment with his or her employer of at least the minimum employment period; and

                     (b)  one or more of the following apply:

                             (i)  a modern award covers the person;

                            (ii)  an enterprise agreement applies to the person in relation to the employment;

                           (iii)  the sum of the person s annual rate of earnings, and such other amounts (if any) worked out in relation to the person in accordance with the regulations, is less than the high income threshold.

##### <a id="383"></a>383  Meaning of _minimum employment period_

                   The **_minimum employment period_** is:

                     (a)  if the employer is not a small business employer - 6 months ending at the earlier of the following times:

                             (i)  the time when the person is given notice of the dismissal;

                            (ii)  immediately before the dismissal; or

                     (b)  if the employer is a small business employer - one year ending at that time.

##### <a id="384"></a>384  Period of employment

            (1)  An employee s **_period of employment_** with an employer at a particular time is the period of continuous service the employee has completed with the employer at that time as an employee.

            (2)  However:

                     (a)  a period of service as a casual employee does not count towards the employee s period of employment unless:

                             (i)  the employment as a casual employee was on a regular and systematic basis; and

                            (ii)  during the period of service as a casual employee, the employee had a reasonable expectation of continuing employment by the employer on a regular and systematic basis; and

                     (b)  if:

                             (i)  the employee is a transferring employee in relation to a transfer of business from an old employer to a new employer; and

                            (ii)  the old employer and the new employer are not associated entities when the employee becomes employed by the new employer; and

                           (iii)  the new employer informed the employee in writing before the new employment started that a period of service with the old employer would not be recognised;

                           the period of service with the old employer does not count towards the employee s period of employment with the new employer.

### Division 3 - What is an unfair dismissal

##### <a id="385"></a>385  What is an unfair dismissal

                   A person has been **_unfairly dismissed_** if the FWC is satisfied that:

                     (b)  the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable; and

                     (c)  the dismissal was not consistent with the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code; and

                     (d)  the dismissal was not a case of genuine redundancy.

Note:          For the definition of **_consistent with the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code_**: see section 388.

##### <a id="386"></a>386  Meaning of _dismissed_

            (1)  A person has been **_dismissed_** if:

                     (b)  the person has resigned from his or her employment, but was forced to do so because of conduct, or a course of conduct, engaged in by his or her employer.

            (2)  However, a person has not been **_dismissed_** if:

                     (a)  the person was employed under a contract of employment for a specified period of time, for a specified task, or for the duration of a specified season, and the employment has terminated at the end of the period, on completion of the task, or at the end of the season; or

                     (b)  the person was an employee:

                             (i)  to whom a training arrangement applied; and

                            (ii)  whose employment was for a specified period of time or was, for any reason, limited to the duration of the training arrangement;

                           and the employment has terminated at the end of the training arrangement; or

                     (c)  the person was demoted in employment but:

                             (i)  the demotion does not involve a significant reduction in his or her remuneration or duties; and

                            (ii)  he or she remains employed with the employer that effected the demotion.

            (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to a person employed under a contract of a kind referred to in paragraph (2)(a) if a substantial purpose of the employment of the person under a contract of that kind is, or was at the time of the person s employment, to avoid the employer s obligations under this Part.

##### <a id="387"></a>387  Criteria for considering harshness etc.

                   In considering whether it is satisfied that a dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, the FWC must take into account:

                     (b)  whether the person was notified of that reason; and

                     (c)  whether the person was given an opportunity to respond to any reason related to the capacity or conduct of the person; and

                     (d)  any unreasonable refusal by the employer to allow the person to have a support person present to assist at any discussions relating to dismissal; and

                     (e)  if the dismissal related to unsatisfactory performance by the person - whether the person had been warned about that unsatisfactory performance before the dismissal; and

                      (f)  the degree to which the size of the employer s enterprise would be likely to impact on the procedures followed in effecting the dismissal; and

                     (g)  the degree to which the absence of dedicated human resource management specialists or expertise in the enterprise would be likely to impact on the procedures followed in effecting the dismissal; and

                     (h)  any other matters that the FWC considers relevant.

##### <a id="388"></a>388  The Small Business Fair Dismissal Code

            (1)  The Minister may, by legislative instrument, declare a Small Business Fair Dismissal Code.

            (2)  A person s dismissal was **_consistent with the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code_** if:

                     (b)  the employer complied with the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code in relation to the dismissal.

##### <a id="389"></a>389  Meaning of _genuine redundancy_

            (1)  A person s dismissal was a case of **_genuine redundancy_** if:

                     (b)  the employer has complied with any obligation in a modern award or enterprise agreement that applied to the employment to consult about the redundancy.

            (2)  A person s dismissal was not a case of **_genuine redundancy_** if it would have been reasonable in all the circumstances for the person to be redeployed within:

                     (a)  the employer s enterprise; or

                     (b)  the enterprise of an associated entity of the employer.

### Division 4 - Remedies for unfair dismissal

##### <a id="390"></a>390  When the FWC may order remedy for unfair dismissal

            (1)  Subject to subsection (3), the FWC may order a person s reinstatement, or the payment of compensation to a person, if:

                     (b)  the person has been unfairly dismissed (see Division 3).

            (2)  The FWC may make the order only if the person has made an application under section 394.

            (3)  The FWC must not order the payment of compensation to the person unless:

                     (a)  the FWC is satisfied that reinstatement of the person is inappropriate; and

                     (b)  the FWC considers an order for payment of compensation is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

                     (b)  appointing the person to another position on terms and conditions no less favourable than those on which the person was employed immediately before the dismissal.

          (1A)  If:

                     (b)  that position, or an equivalent position, is a position with an associated entity of the employer;

the order under subsection (1) may be an order to the associated entity to:

                     (b)  the period of the person s continuous service with the employer, or (if subsection (1A) applies) the associated entity.

Order to restore lost pay

            (3)  If the FWC makes an order under subsection (1) and considers it appropriate to do so, the FWC may also make any order that the FWC considers appropriate to cause the employer to pay to the person an amount for the remuneration lost, or likely to have been lost, by the person because of the dismissal.

            (4)  In determining an amount for the purposes of an order under subsection (3), the FWC must take into account:

                     (a)  the effect of the order on the viability of the employer s enterprise; and

                     (b)  the length of the person s service with the employer; and

                     (e)  the amount of any remuneration earned by the person from employment or other work during the period between the dismissal and the making of the order for compensation; and

                      (f)  the amount of any income reasonably likely to be so earned by the person during the period between the making of the order for compensation and the actual compensation; and

                     (g)  any other matter that the FWC considers relevant.

Misconduct reduces amount

            (3)  If the FWC is satisfied that misconduct of a person contributed to the employer s decision to dismiss the person, the FWC must reduce the amount it would otherwise order under subsection (1) by an appropriate amount on account of the misconduct.

Shock, distress etc. disregarded

            (4)  The amount ordered by the FWC to be paid to a person under subsection (1) must not include a component by way of compensation for shock, distress or humiliation, or other analogous hurt, caused to the person by the manner of the person s dismissal.

                           (whichever is higher) for any period of employment with the employer during the 26 weeks immediately before the dismissal; and

                     (b)  if the employee was on leave without pay or without full pay while so employed during any part of that period - the amount of remuneration taken to have been received by the employee for the period of leave in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="393"></a>393  Monetary orders may be in instalments

## Part 3-3 - Industrial action

### Division 1 - Introduction

##### <a id="406"></a>406  Guide to this Part

* * *

This Part deals mainly with industrial action by national system employees and national system employers.

Division 2 sets out when industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement is protected industrial action. No action lies under any law in force in a State or Territory in relation to protected industrial action except in certain circumstances.

Division 3 provides that industrial action must not be organised or engaged in by certain persons before the nominal expiry date of an enterprise agreement or workplace determination has passed.

Division 4 provides for the FWC to make orders, in certain circumstances, that industrial action stop, not occur or not be organised for a specified period.

Division 5 deals with injunctions against industrial action if a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement is engaging in pattern bargaining.

Division 6 provides for the FWC to make orders suspending or terminating protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement in certain circumstances. If the FWC makes such an order, the action will no longer be protected industrial action.

Division 7 provides for the Minister to make a declaration terminating protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement in certain circumstances. If the Minister makes such an order, the action will no longer be protected industrial action.

Division 8 establishes the process that will allow employees to choose, by means of a fair and democratic secret ballot, whether to authorise protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement.

Division 9 sets out restrictions about payments to employees relating to periods of industrial action.

Division 10 deals with the making of applications under this Part.

* * *

##### <a id="436"></a>436  Object of this Division

                   The object of this Division is to establish a fair, simple and democratic process to allow a bargaining representative to determine whether employees wish to engage in particular protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement.

Note:          Under Division 2, industrial action by employees for a proposed enterprise agreement (other than employee response action) is not protected industrial action unless it has been authorised in advance by a protected action ballot.

#### Subdivision B - Protected action ballot orders

##### <a id="437"></a>437  Application for a protected action ballot order

Who may apply for a protected action ballot order

            (1)  A bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement, or 2 or more such bargaining representatives (acting jointly), may apply to the FWC for an order (a **_protected action ballot order_**) requiring a protected action ballot to be conducted to determine whether employees wish to engage in particular protected industrial action for the agreement.

            (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the proposed enterprise agreement is:

                     (a)  a greenfields agreement; or

                     (b)  a multi-enterprise agreement.

Matters to be specified in application

            (3)  The application must specify:

                     (a)  the group or groups of employees who are to be balloted; and

                     (b)  the question or questions to be put to the employees who are to be balloted, including the nature of the proposed industrial action.

            (4)  If the applicant wishes a person other than the Australian Electoral Commission to be the protected action ballot agent for the protected action ballot, the application must specify the name of the person.

Note:          The protected action ballot agent will be the Australian Electoral Commission unless the FWC specifies another person in the protected action ballot order as the protected action ballot agent (see subsection 443(4)).

            (5)  A group of employees specified under paragraph (3)(a) is taken to include only employees who:

                     (a)  will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement; and

                     (b)  either:

                             (i)  are represented by a bargaining representative who is an applicant for the protected action ballot order; or

                            (ii)  are bargaining representatives for themselves but are members of an employee organisation that is an applicant for the protected action ballot order.

Documents to accompany application

            (6)  The application must be accompanied by any documents and other information prescribed by the regulations.

##### <a id="438"></a>438  Restriction on when application may be made

            (1)  If one or more enterprise agreements cover the employees who will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement, an application for a protected action ballot order must not be made earlier than 30 days before the nominal expiry date of the enterprise agreement, or the latest nominal expiry date of those enterprise agreements (as the case may be).

            (2)  To avoid doubt, making an application for a protected action ballot order does not constitute organising industrial action.

##### <a id="439"></a>439  Joint applications

                   Without limiting section 609, the procedural rules may provide for the following:

                     (a)  how a provision of this Act that applies in relation to an applicant for a protected action ballot order is to apply in relation to joint applicants for such an order;

                     (b)  the joinder, with the consent of each existing applicant, of one or more bargaining representatives to an application for a protected action ballot order;

                     (c)  the withdrawal of one or more applicants from a joint application for a protected action ballot order.

##### <a id="440"></a>440  Notice of application

                   Within 24 hours after making an application for a protected action ballot order, the applicant must give a copy of the application to the employer of the employees who are to be balloted, and:

                     (a)  if the application specifies a person that the applicant wishes to be the protected action ballot agent - that person; or

                     (b)  otherwise - the Australian Electoral Commission.

##### <a id="441"></a>441  Application to be determined within 2 days after it is made

            (1)  The FWC must, as far as practicable, determine an application for a protected action ballot order within 2 working days after the application is made.

            (2)  However, the FWC must not determine the application unless it is satisfied that each applicant has complied with section 440.

##### <a id="442"></a>442  Dealing with multiple applications together

                   The FWC may deal with 2 or more applications for a protected action ballot order at the same time if:

                     (a)  the applications relate to industrial action by:

                             (i)  employees of the same employer; or

                            (ii)  employees at the same workplace; and

                     (b)  the FWC is satisfied that dealing with the applications at the same time will not unreasonably delay the determination of any of the applications.

##### <a id="443"></a>443  When the FWC must make a protected action ballot order

            (1)  The FWC must make a protected action ballot order in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement if:

                     (a)  an application has been made under section 437; and

                     (b)  the FWC is satisfied that each applicant has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the employer of the employees who are to be balloted.

            (2)  The FWC must not make a protected action ballot order in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement except in the circumstances referred to in subsection (1).

            (3)  A protected action ballot order must specify the following:

                     (a)  the name of each applicant for the order;

                     (b)  the group or groups of employees who are to be balloted;

                     (c)  the date by which voting in the protected action ballot closes;

                     (d)  the question or questions to be put to the employees who are to be balloted, including the nature of the proposed industrial action.

          (3A)  For the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the FWC must specify a date that will enable the protected action ballot to be conducted as expeditiously as practicable.

            (4)  If the FWC decides that a person other than the Australian Electoral Commission is to be the protected action ballot agent for the protected action ballot, the protected action ballot order must also specify:

                     (a)  the person that the FWC decides, under subsection 444(1), is to be the protected action ballot agent; and

                     (b)  the person (if any) that the FWC decides, under subsection 444(3), is to be the independent advisor for the ballot.

            (5)  If the FWC is satisfied, in relation to the proposed industrial action that is the subject of the protected action ballot, that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the period of written notice referred to in paragraph 414(2)(a) being longer than 3 working days, the protected action ballot order may specify a longer period of up to 7 working days.

Note:          Under subsection 414(1), before a person engages in employee claim action for a proposed enterprise agreement, a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by the agreement must give written notice of the action to the employer of the employee.

##### <a id="444"></a>444  FWC may decide on ballot agent other than the Australian Electoral Commission and independent advisor

Alternative ballot agent

                     (b)  the FWC is satisfied that:

                             (i)  the person is a fit and proper person to conduct the ballot; and

Independent advisor

            (3)  The FWC may decide that a person (the **_other person_**) is to be the independent advisor for a protected action ballot if:

                     (a)  the FWC has decided that a person other than the Australian Electoral Commission is to be the protected action ballot agent for the ballot; and

                     (b)  the FWC considers it appropriate that there be an independent advisor for the ballot; and

                     (c)  the FWC is satisfied that:

                             (i)  the other person is sufficiently independent of each applicant for the protected action ballot order; and

                     (a)  that the level of disruption of the employer s enterprise, or at the workplace, could be reduced if the ballots were held at the same time; and

                     (b)  that requiring the ballots to be held at the same time will not unreasonably delay either ballot.

                     (b)  has complied with any requirements, relating to the giving of the notice, prescribed by the regulations.

Employer does not give notice

            (8)  If:

                     (a)  an employee engaged, or engages, in protected industrial action against an employer on a day; and

                     (b)  the industrial action is a partial work ban; and

                     (c)  the employer does not give the employee a notice in accordance with paragraph (1)(c) or (4)(c);

then the employee s payments for the day are not to be reduced because of the ban.

##### <a id="472"></a>472  Orders by the FWC relating to certain partial work bans

            (1)  The FWC may make an order varying the proportion by which an employee s payments are reduced.

            (2)  The FWC may make the order only if a person has applied for it under subsection (4).

            (3)  In considering making such an order, the FWC must take into account:

                     (a)  whether the proportion specified in the notice given under paragraph 471(1)(c) was reasonable having regard to the nature and extent of the partial work ban to which the notice relates; and

                     (b)  fairness between the parties taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case.

            (4)  An employee, or the employee s bargaining representative, may apply to the FWC for an order under subsection (2) if a notice has been given under paragraph 471(1)(c) stating that the employee s payments will be reduced.

##### <a id="473"></a>473  Accepting or seeking payments relating to periods of industrial action

            (1)  An employee must not:

                     (a)  accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene section 470 by making the payment; or

                     (b)  ask the employer to make such a payment.

Note 1:       This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       Acts of coercion, or misrepresentations, relating to such payments may also contravene section 348 or 349.

            (2)  An employee organisation, or an officer or member of an employee organisation, must not ask an employer to make a payment to an employee if the employer would contravene section 470 by making the payment.

Note 1:       This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       Acts of coercion, or misrepresentations, relating to such payments may also contravene section 348 or 349.

#### Subdivision B - Industrial action that is not protected industrial action

##### <a id="474"></a>474  Payments not to be made relating to certain periods of industrial action

            (1)  If an employee engaged, or engages, in industrial action that is not protected industrial action against an employer on a day, the employer must not make a payment to an employee in relation to:

                     (a)  if the total duration of the industrial action on that day is at least 4 hours - the total duration of the industrial action on that day; or

                     (b)  otherwise - 4 hours of that day.

Note:          This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

            (2)  However, if the industrial action is, or includes, an overtime ban, this section does not apply, in relation to a period of overtime to which the ban applies, unless:

                     (a)  the employer requested or required the employee to work the period of overtime; and

                     (b)  the employee refused to work the period of overtime; and

                     (c)  the refusal was a contravention of the employee s obligations under a modern award, enterprise agreement or contract of employment.

Note:          An employee is able to refuse to work additional hours if they are unreasonable (see subsection 62(2)). There may be other circumstances in which an employee can lawfully refuse to work additional hours.

          (2A)  If:

                     (a)  the industrial action is, or includes, an overtime ban; and

                     (b)  this section applies in relation to a period of overtime to which the ban applies;

then, for the purposes of this section:

                     (c)  the total duration of the industrial action is, or includes, the period of overtime to which the ban applies; and

                     (d)  if paragraph (1)(b) applies - the period of 4 hours mentioned in that paragraph includes the period of overtime to which the ban applies.

            (3)  If:

                     (a)  the industrial action is during a shift (or other period of work); and

                     (b)  the shift (or other period of work) occurs partly on one day and partly on the next day;

then, for the purposes of this section, the shift is taken to be a day and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of that day.

Example:    An employee, who is working a shift from 10 pm on Tuesday until 7 am on Wednesday, engages in industrial action that is not protected industrial action from 11 pm on Tuesday until 1 am on Wednesday. That industrial action would prevent the employer making a payment to the employee in relation to 4 hours of the shift, but would not prevent the employer from making a payment in relation to the remaining 5 hours of the shift.

            (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), overtime is taken not to be a separate shift.

##### <a id="475"></a>475  Accepting or seeking payments relating to periods of industrial action

            (1)  An employee must not:

                     (a)  accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene section 474 by making the payment; or

                     (b)  ask the employer to make such a payment.

Note 1:       This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       Acts of coercion, or misrepresentations, relating to such payments may also contravene section 348 or 349.

            (2)  An employee organisation, or an officer or member of an employee organisation, must not ask an employer to make a payment to an employee if the employer would contravene section 474 by making the payment.

Note 1:       This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).

Note 2:       Acts of coercion, or misrepresentations, relating to such payments may also contravene section 348 or 349.

#### Subdivision C_-_Miscellaneous

##### <a id="476"></a>476  Other responses to industrial action unaffected

                   If an employee engaged, or engages, in industrial action against an employer, this Division does not affect any right of the employer, under this Act or otherwise, to do anything in response to the industrial action that does not involve payments to the employee.

### Division 10 - Other matters

##### <a id="477"></a>477  Applications by bargaining representatives

Persons who may make applications

            (2)  If the agreement will cover more than one employer, the application may be made by:

                     (a)  in the case of a proposed single-enterprise agreement in relation to which a single interest employer authorisation is in operation - the person (if any) specified in the authorisation as the person who may make applications under this Act; or

                             (i)  this Act and fair work instruments; and

                            (ii)  State or Territory OHS laws; and

                     (b)  the right of employees and TCF award workers to receive, at work, information and representation from officials of organisations; and

### Division 2 - Entry rights under this Act

#### Subdivision A - Entry to investigate suspected contravention

##### <a id="481"></a>481  Entry to investigate suspected contravention

            (1)  A permit holder may enter premises and exercise a right under section 482 or 483 for the purpose of investigating a suspected contravention of this Act, or a term of a fair work instrument, that relates to, or affects, a member of the permit holder s organisation:

                     (a)  whose industrial interests the organisation is entitled to represent; and

                     (b)  who performs work on the premises.

            (2)  The fair work instrument must apply or have applied to the member.

            (3)  The permit holder must reasonably suspect that the contravention has occurred, or is occurring. The burden of proving that the suspicion is reasonable lies on the person asserting that fact.

Note:          A permit holder who seeks to exercise rights under this Part without reasonably suspecting that a contravention has occurred, or is occurring, is liable to be penalised under subsection 503(1) (which deals with misrepresentations about things authorised by this Part).

##### <a id="482"></a>482  Rights that may be exercised while on premises

(a)     prevent the premises being entered for that purpose under Subdivision A; or

(b)    prevent the premises being entered under paragraph (1)(b) of this section.

            (7)  Before the Governor-General makes a regulation specifying a particular person or body for the purposes of paragraph (6)(a), the Minister must be satisfied that the person or body:
